            <p>Grave Keeper is a Rescuer who can take up to 2 additional hits, which also allows him to get to the chair safely with additional passives that help him rescue more easily. </p>

  <h1 id="external-traits">External Traits and Abilities</h1>

<p>His first and main ability is called “Dig to Escape”. Grave Keeper starts the game with 2 shovels. They allow him to go underground for a considerable amount of time. </p>  
                
      <!-- Centered Image Link -->
      <div class="image-container">

</div>


<p>While Grave Keeper is underground, he can’t get stunned and clears all negative statuses (for example, Hermit’s polarity or Disciple’s cats). The shovel also absorbs damage equal to one basic attack. After taking a hit or two chips, he will be forced to resurface. Keep in mind that you won’t get the hit speed boost and the hunter will have a 10% faster attack recovery. </p>
<p>The shovel lasts up to 35 seconds and you will resurface automatically after the time ends. However, you can tap the ability again to exit early. This will out the shovel on cooldown for 20 seconds and reduce its duration on next use. Keep in mind the animation of both going in and out of shovel. You can’t move or interact with anything, making yourself vulnerable. The hunter can also hit you during this animation, which will cancel the shovel and the hit will register. </p>

<p>While underground, Grave Keeper cannot interact with windows, pallets or chairs. He can, however, go underneath already dropped pallets. It is a good strategy to use on kites. Predrop a pallet, shovel and go underneath it. The hunter will be forced to break it in most cases.</p>

<p>When you’re shoveling in an area with two floors, Grave Keeper also has an option to exit shovel and go downstairs, leaving a hole behind. The hunter can drop down the hole as well and hit you, so keep it in mind. This ability is most useful during basement rescues, which we will talk about later. </p>

<p>Other traits he has are also connected with his shovels.</p>

<p>He also gets a rescuing speed buff when exiting the shovel on his own. This ability is called “At ease”. </p>

<p>This buff lasts for 5 seconds and makes him the faster rescuer in the game.</p>

<p>His last ability is a decoding debuff called “All Thumbs”, which increases the time he needs to finish a cipher machine by 15%. </p>

<h1 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h1>
        <p> Usually, the main build used for Grave Keeper is Borrowed Time and Tide. </p>

        <h2 id="persona-web">Persona Web</h2>
        <p>Mercenary has strong kiting abilities and doesn’t need additional support from broken windows or flywheel. You can mix and match a lot of secondary traits with him, such as “healing” (healing speed increase), “will to survive” (struggle speed) or “great power” (duration of pallet stuns increase). However, bringing things like “symbiotic effect” (increases speed while running towards chaired survivors) will make rescues easier and more consistent. Don’t forget to bring “exit path” as well. It’s a trait that should be used in all survivor builds. </p>

<p>He has a strong enough kiting ability and doesn’t require additional help. As for secondary traits, you can bring Will to Survive, Great Power, Brewing Effect or Companion Effect.</p>

<p>It is also useful to bring Symbiotic Effect. This will make rescues easier and more consistent. Don’t forget to bring Exit Path as well. It’s a trait that should be used in all survivor builds. </p>

    <h1 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h1>
    <div class="image-container">

<p>Grave Keeper is considered good on all maps. However, he can struggle with large distances, so when playing on large maps try to go for the rescue even earlier than usual. </p>

</div>


  <h1 id="counters">Counters</h1>

  <p>Grave Keeper doesn’t have any specific counters and only struggles on rescue against chip hunters. These include Sculptor, Naiad and Guard 26.</p>

  <p>Be careful with the timing of your shovel when rescuing against them. Try to approach a chair, bait and dodge the ability and use the At ease trait when possible. </p>


  <h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>

<p>At the start of the game, as a rescuer, you will have to take the weakest area when spawns are available (middle on Arms Factory or China Town, for example). Decode as much as possible early game. It’s unlikely you will get first chase. If you do, however, try to use the area around you first, then shovel to rotate. Use your shovel only on a safe distance from the hunter or behind a pallet or a window. This will ensure that you won’t waste your ability. </p>

<p>As soon as someone gets chaired, you will mostly like have to go for the rescue. Make your way up to the chair. If you see the hunter meeting you, shovel and get as close as possible. If the hunter doesn’t hit you out of shovel, exit it right in front of chair. Wait a second or two before rescuing with the buff and try to bait a hit by crouching or just standing.  This will ensure you won’t get terrorshocked. Once you rescue, try to avoid a double down and run to one of your teammates. Don’t try to bodyblock (take the hit for your teammate) with your shovel unless your teammate is dead on chair and the ciphers are almost done. It’s more efficient to switch places with someone and continue decoding or get healed and go for another rescue. Usually, however, it’s better to prioritize decoding. </p>

<h1 id="gameplay">Basement Rescues </h1>

<p>As mentioned earlier, Grave Keeper has the ability to go down a floor with his shovel. If you’re underground and there’s space below, another button will appear on the side. Press it and you will fall down.  </p>

<p>Don’t forget it will leave a hole upstairs which a hunter can go through. Try to use this ability a bit further away. </p>

<p>As Grave Keeper, you can use this trick to drop down right next to your teammate’s chair in basement and rescue. </p>

  <p>This will also grant the “at ease” buff. To exit basement, you will still have to make it up the stairs, so it’s still recommended to rescue only with tide or when cipher is primed. </p>
