        <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>
        <p>Mercenary is a rescue type character. He has abilities to help him reach the chair safely, rescue his teammates and navigate the map quickly. He’s a strong kiter as well, making him a problem to deal with for most hunters. A good Mercenary will guarantee an easier time for all of his teammates. </p>

                <!-- Centered Image Link -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063257/2digram_csyqzu.png" alt="Undead Chart">

            </div>


    <h2 id="traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>
<p>Mercenary starts the game with 3 items, elbow pads, which grant him the ability to iron dash. Simply put, he can dash to gain distance. This can be used both on kite and rescue. </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063257/3iron_dash_yd7kfl.png" alt="Iron Dash">
    </div>
    <p>To use an elbow pad, you will first have to press the skill button to activate it. Then stand near a wall or any surface with collision – the dash will trigger automatically. After the dash ends the item will enter a 5 second cooldown during which you can’t use it again. </p>

    </video>

    <p>Don’t forget to press the skill button again to turn off the elbow pad. Otherwise, you will immediately dash once the requirements are met again.  It’s easier to treat your elbow pads as instant use items and simply turn them off mid dash. </p>
<p>Mercenary can also give his items to other players. To do that, you will have to get another item first and switch between them. Note that if you leave 3 elbow pads on the ground, all other survivors will get only 2 of them. </p>
<p>Elbow pads can be controlled both by camera and joystick/mouse movements. Try for yourself and see which one is more comfortable. They conflict with each other so it’s important to choose one style of controls. Using both at the same time may result in sending you in a completely different direction or even making a circle elbow pad. </p>

    <p>You can also try doing a backwards elbow pad which can help you, especially during rescues or on gates. </p>

    <p>There are a lot of objects you can elbow pad off. However, its preferable to use straight surfaces (walls, boxes, fences, etc.) Dashing from objects with a weird angle (trees, for example) may mess up your elbow pad. </p>

    <p>Another trait Mercenary has is called “skilled”. It increases his obstacle vaulting speed by 10% compared to other survivors. </p>

    <p>“Steel will” is another essential ability he has. Mercenary sits on a rocket chair 10% longer. He also has an 8 second hit delay. This means that he will not actually take the damage until the time passes. A chip takes 4 seconds to register, and it takes him 16 seconds in total to go down. He can be knocked down earlier if his fear exceeds the limit (for example, getting terrorshocked and then hit immediately/getting hit once when injured and chipped). </p>

    <p>During this time, he can move, interact with objects, rescue, etc. It allows him to rescue even when wounded and not get downed immediately.  </p>

<p>The last ability Mercenary has is called “shell shocked”. It reduces his decoding speed by 25%, making him one of the slowest decoders in game. Every injury Mercenary takes also increases his time to heal by 15%, up to 75%. It makes him a good target for being slugged – being left on the ground without getting chaired. </p>

    <h2 id="persona-web">Persona Web</h2>
    <p>Mercenary has strong kiting abilities and doesn't need additional support from broken windows or flywheel. You can mix and match a lot of secondary traits with him, such as “healing” (healing speed increase), “will to survive” (struggle speed) or “great power” (duration of pallet stuns increase). However, bringing things like “symbiotic effect” (increases speed while running towards chaired survivors) will make rescues easier and more consistent. Don’t forget to bring “exit path” as well. It’s a trait that should be used in all survivor builds. </p>

    <h2 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h2>
<p> Mercenary is considered a strong survivor and is good on all maps. However, due to his ability to quickly cover large distances, he shines on big open maps like Moonlit River Park, Lakeside Village, China Town, Leo’s Memory and Eversleeping Town. On smaller maps your elbow pads will have to be more precise due to some crowded spaces. </p>
    <h2 id="bans-counters">Counters</h2>

    <p>Mercenary doesn’t really have any direct counters, he’s a strong survivor all around. However, there are hunters who you can struggle against. For the sake of simplicity, let’s separate them in two groups: rescue counters and chase counters. 
        Rescue counters are hunters that excel at chair camping and might give a double down or completely stop the rescue. These include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mad Eyes</li>
            <li>Guard 26</li>
            <li>Sculptor</li>
  
        </ul>

        <p>When rescuing against them, it’s recommended to go earlier and try to bait and dodge their abilities. Don’t forget that if you get chipped once and then terrorshocked, you will go down. You can also bait them to swing by getting on and off the chair, crouching, standing near, etc. </p>
<p>Mercenary is a survivor whose main ability is gaining distance and likely won’t be chased in early game. However, some hunters, especially those who can catch up fast, aren’t afraid of going for Mercenary. These include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Smiley Face </li>
    <li>Undead</li>
    <li>Opera Singer</li>

</ul>

<p>For those hunters, try to use your elbow pads to get to a better area against them. Use raw kiting otherwise. Don’t forget to die as far from the chair as possible when going down to win some time for decoding. Keep in mind that Photographer completely counters Merc, because of his passive and camera world. </p>

    <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>  When playing Mercenary, you will usually take the weakest map area when spawns are active (middle on China Town, for example). Immediately get on a cipher since its unlikely you’re going to get chased. Decode as much as possible while your teammate is kiting. Some hunters will try to chase you for a bit to force some items and will leave soon after. Don’t be afraid of using your elbow pads. It’s better to avoid a hit than waste time healing. </p> 
<p>As soon as someone gets downed, assess the situation. Ask yourself first “Should I rescue?”. If you decide to go for a rescue, it’s better to let your cipher be and go to the chair early, then stall or try to go for a no-hit. Otherwise, you might risk getting a rescue immediately after half. Don’t be afraid of farming them off chair when you have tide. They will have 20 seconds to run to the corner of the map and give you time to switch places with someone or rescue again. </p>
<p>Don’t bodyblock (take the hit for your teammate) after the first rescue. Your main priority is not giving a double down, this will slow down the game and give the hunter an upper hand. Bodyblock only when necessary - when you’re already going down (for example, you got terroshocked on chair) or after the second rescue, so they could survive until the cipher is primed.</p>




    <h2 id="basement-rescues">Basement Rescues</h2>
<p> Basement rescues are among the hardest things you will have to do. If you decide the rescue is worth it, it’s important to learn how to elbow pad inside basement. To get a clean dash, elbow pad off the wall next to an entrance. </p>

    <p>Note that you can still get hit while dashing but this will not cancel the dash. Go to the chair and rescue. Your teammate should leave immediately and get as far from basement as possible. You can run together with them or stay behind for a bit. The hunter will most likely go after another survivor, guaranteeing you can leave safely. </p>

<p>In general, don’t be afraid of making mistakes or messing up, especially at the beginning. Playing rescue is one of the hardest things in the game. Don’t give up, practice, listen to advice and analyze your mistakes so you can do better next time! </p>
