        <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>
        <p>Coordinator is a secondary rescue type character, meant to primarily be played as a kiter. Unlike other rescuers she only has one item to use, which is her Flare Gun. A good Coordinator can turn the tides of the match by mid-kite harassing and using her gun optimally.  </p>

                <!-- Centered Image Link -->
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="./assets/Strengths.png" alt="Strengths">
                </a>
            </div>
<p>As for most rescuers her decoding performance is quiet poor in exchange. But her kit overall is decent enough to make her niche.</p>

    <h2 id="traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>


<p> As mentioned Coordinators one and only ability is one Flare Gun. It stuns the hunter for five seconds on average giving you or whoever it is you're protecting enough time to rotate and possibly rebound.</p>

      <!-- Centered Image Link -->
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./assets/PreciseAim.png" alt="Kapew">
    </a>
</div>

<p>Guns can be used in a variety of ways for example:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Balloon rescue a teammate</li>
    <li>Midkite support for yourself or a teammate</li>
    <li>Rebound</li>
</ul>
  
   <p> Keep in mind that this is your one shot and one shot only. So be sure to make it count. When done right, it has the potential to turn the entire match around, positively or negatively.</p> 


<video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/Balloon Rescue.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

<p>You can balloon rescue a ballooned teammate if you time it properly and don't hit any obstacles like walls or the Hunter uses Excitement. 
    Keep in mind this is highly situational and fairly difficult to pull off, because the Hunter can also just drop. 
    If you really decide to do this you need to be at the scene before chairing takes place to pressure properly and be patient enough to get the Hunter to drop a lot or mindgame them into getting a succesful gun.
Don't risk this if it's in a heavily walled off or enclosed area, where it's easy for you to miss. At that point just keep the gun for late game. Mindgaming can be achieved by using her Provoke emote or even Advance.

</p>

<p>Alternatively, you should keep your gun and try to use it to support a teammate midkite. 
    This means that you rush in while they are kiting for a long stun and then leave immediately after. 
    This can seriously mess up the Hunter, but should only be done against ones that don't easily close distance. Beware of Excitement and ask yourself if they bring it.</p>

    <video width="600" controls>
        <source src="./assets/Midkite Gun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <p>You can also use the gun for yourself of course. Ideally, you should keep it for your rebound kite so you have something to rebound with after being rescued. However, with some hunters you might want to use it during midkite as to not feed them the presence they need. When kiting yourself open areas are your friend if you want and need to get a gun off. Lure the Hunter into nice open areas to get a safe gun off. Do not try to risk it in tight and cramped spaces or you will mess up. Work with your camera POV to look behind you to double check in case you get juked.</p>

<p> Coordinator also has a passive that - like most other rescuers - decreases her Chair countdown. In this case it's reduced by 10%. </p>

<!-- Centered Image Link -->
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="./assets/Steel_Will.png" alt="Kapew">

</div>

<p> Her external trait Army Bond regulates her decoding and reduces it by 25% after someone is chaired. The 5% movement speed boost helps her reach the chair faster and easier, because Coordinator isn't very mobile.</p>

<!-- Centered Image Link -->
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="./assets/Army_Bond.png" alt="Kapew">
</a>
</div>


<p> Coordinator also has increased vaulting speed by 10% to help her kite better. She also gets increased movement speed by 15% and a vault speed boost of 10% for 4 seconds upon approaching a pallet or window. This resets every 40 seconds. It can act as a mini Knee Jerk Reflex.</p>

<p>Coordinator has strong kiting abilities, but could bring either Tide Turner or Knee Jerk Reflex.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p> If you're the primary Rescuer on the team you should try to spawn in the weakest areas. If you're playing more of a Kiter role then you can spawn in the 2nd worst area and give the worst one to the actual Rescuer while bringing Knee Jerk Reflex instead of Tide Turner. </p>


<p> Try to start off decoding unless you think the Hunter will target you. You should already know this based off the spawns in area selection. If you're unsure rotate. After that you should follow the guideline for rescues in general.</p>

<p> Try to conserve your gun for a situation and always be on the lookout for good opportunities to gun midkite. The follow me ping can help others locate you easily so that they can kite towards you for gun support. Beware of Excitement.</p>
