<p>
    Welcome to IdentityV Guides! We provide high-quality, up-to-date information about survivors and hunters in IdentityV, making it easy for you to start learning about them.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a two-person team, we noticed that many guides, especially for niche hunters like Undead and BonBon, are often outdated or lacking altogether. With one of us holding an S badge as Guard 26 and the other as Undead, we decided to create a resource that fills these gaps.
    Our website allows us to keep everything current, offering effective strategies and insights that help you understand each character and use them successfully in rank matches.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're an expert for a certain hunter please reach out through our contact form. Please keep in mind that during the starting phase of this website we will be more focussed on the hunter faction.
