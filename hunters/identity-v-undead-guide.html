        <h1 id="classification">Classification and Type</h1>
        <p>Undead is a pure chase single hit hunter. Not only can he quickly traverse the map with his five dashes, but use them in chase to land hits or close distance quickly. Because of his ability to chase so well, he isn't allowed to camp at all and has basically no cipher control.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063323/UndeadType_y6dj0h.webp" alt="Undead Chase">
        </div>
        <p>As a formidable chase hunter he's both capable and forced to end chases quickly in an attempt to snowball. His abilities enable him to do this, making it hard to transition against or kite him in open areas. However, he's easily tight kited and looped as well as rushed.</p>

        <h1 id="external-traits">External Traits and Abilities</h1>
        <p> Energy Charge is Undead's main trait besides Surrogate. It allows him to increase his Energy Load by using his abilities, which further enhances them. From 0-49 energy this simply does nothing and counts as "Uncharged". However, once the meter is between 50-99 Undead will enter an energy surge state during which his regular attack can break pallets and can't be interrupted. Both of his abilities will also be enhanced significantly. If his energy reaches 100 he will overload, which decreases movement speed by 8% and locks all abilities for 14 seconds.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063325/Energy_Charge_txavna.png" alt="Energy Charge">
        </div>
      <p>This means you can't get stunned by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pallets</li>
            <li>Cricket balls (Batter)</li>
            <li>Flare guns (Coordinator)</li>
            <li>Paintings (Painter)</li>
            <li>Stacks (Enchantress)</li>
            <li>Bees (Entomologist)</li>
            <li>Lasso (Cowboy)</li>
            <li>Magnets (Prospector)</li>
            <li>Flute (Antiquarian)</li>
            <li>Memory Fragment (Little Girl)</li>
            <li>Nitre Bombs (Acrobat)</li>
            <li>Scale (Professor)</li>
            <li>Sketchbook (Novelist)</li>
            <li>Zap (Prisoner)</li>
            <li>Flashlight (Thief)</li>
            <li>Rugby Ball (Forward)</li>
   
        </ul>
            
   
            
            <p>Note that this only applies when you're swinging, i.e., using your regular hit or one of the abilities and are in an energy surge state (50-99 energy). You can and will get stunned by all of these if you do not swing or do so improperly.</p>
            
            <p>Another essential ability to understand is Surrogate. Undead is the only hunter in IDV who doesn't pick up and chair survivors at all. Instead, he only downs them to bleed them out, a process known as slugging.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063325/Surrogate_wkxqp2.png" alt="Surrogate Ability">
            </div>
            
            <p>This has many disadvantages but also a few advantages. It's important to keep in mind that every time a survivor is knocked down, elimination progress is increased by 25%. During this time, survivors can use up their self-heal once while their crawling speed is increased by 100%. Something to note is that this stacks with Sticker and counters Peepers, because you can effectively crawl out of their radius fast enough.</p>
            
            <p>Surrogate also has a special effect, which increases the speed at which survivors bleed out by 300% when all of them are knocked down and when the gate is activated. It's important to keep in mind that this can stack up to 600%.</p>
            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            
            
            <p>His last external trait, Frequency Conversion, lets Undead change the dungeon. It's completely random and should be used carefully.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063325/Frequency_Conversion_kgl2io.png" alt="Frequency Conversion">
            </div>
            
        <p>It exposes his own location to the survivors who'll be notified as to where the new dungeon spawns. Undead isn't and he can't cancel this process once activated. This is the main reason as to why it's difficult to 4 man eliminate all survivors as Undead. 
            Usually you'll always have at least one escape. Another very important thing to keep in mind is that survivors can just run up to the dungeon while its being changed or crawl to it and jump inside to escape without Undead being able to do anything about it.</p>

        <p>As for his abilities Undead starts the game with 5 dashes  that deal damage upon hitting the survivor. Undead cannot control his dash unlike Smiley Face and it will end upon hitting a survivor, object or if the maximum distance is reached. It's important to keep in mind that dashes aren't effected by Detention.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063324/Kinetic_Dash_Hit_iifxxx.png" alt="Dash Ability">
        </div>
        <p>Every dash increases energy by 10. 5 dashes gets you to a charged state and energy level of 50. During this state his abilities are enhanced as described above. 
            You can now jump chop hit or double slam survivors with the same abilities. This heavily improves your chase and allows you to pull off certain tricks otherwise not possible. 
        It's suggested to tweak your jump chop sensitivity settings and also turning on the translucent container setting, since Undead's model is quite large.
        </p>
        <p>Go to Settings>Controls>Characters then switch to Undead and turn this setting on.</p>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>Go to Settings>SFX>Characters then switch to Undead to adjust it to your liking.</p>


        <div class="image-container">

        </div>



        <p>The other ability is his charged strike, which is an AOE ranged attack that effects an area and increases in size the longer the button is held for. </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063325/Charged_Strike_beezsm.png" alt="Charged Strike Ability">
        </div>
        <p>If it exceeds a certain threshhold the slam does damage. It also increases energy load by 20 so do not slam if your energy levels are 80+ unless you can warrant overloading. If your energy levels are 50+ then you can slam twice in a row. </p>
        
        <p>Try to set up slams just before a Survivor vaults or drops a pallet. If they're stuck in the vaulting or dropping animation the hit will be guaranteed unless they flywheel it. If you know that they have Flywheel you can purposefully bait it out by charging the slam above the maximum indicator until you see them flywheel. Slams are covered in more detail down below with map specific examples.

          A neat trick you should use is the bottom left points indication on your screen. It confirms whether or not your slam hit by displaying points. 
          
          <div class="image-container">

          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063318/Pointsnotif_pvcmo8.png" alt="Points Notification">
        </div>

          <p> This can save you tons of time and stops the survivor from gaining much if any distance on you, because of the slams otherwise long windup animation. If you don't see the notification you can just stop the ability.</p>

        <p>His last ability unlocks at full presence and simply lets him manage energy levels better. If you're below 50 Energy you will jump to 50 Energy. It can also help you decrease your energy by 50 if necessary to prevent overcharge. This is often done between phases, meaning you use it when you're about to enter a chase so you can instantly break pallets and not get stunned or to decrease energy levels so you can dash normally again without overcharging. </p>

        </div>
        <p>Overall, his abilities reflect a fast and aggressive chase style focused on quickly downing survivors.</p>

        </p> <p>When making a Persona Web you always want to consider the hunters strengths and weaknesses. In Undeads case his strengths are apparent. As we know he doesn't have any camping abilities so points in these traits would be wasted.</p> <p>The reason why we bring Detention is because it can help Undead out a ton late game. While his dashes aren’t effected by it, you can use the dash to close distance and then a regular hit for an instant down. Detention is also justified, because the elimination speed is increased by 300% up to 600% after the gates are activated and if every survivor is knocked down. This gives the player a last chance to secure a tie or possibly turn a tie game into a win.
            
          <p>The main reason Confined Space is used is because of its prerequisites and because Undead due to his horrible regular hitbox and kit gets looped and tight kited very easily. He can counter transitioning survivors or fast survivors well, but as soon as you start looping him around high walls or tight spaces he can't use his dashes properly and is forced to walk up to you and hit you. Confined Space puts a stop to this by blocking windows, which can enable these loops in the first place. It also gives you 3 stacks of Wither and Pallet Breaking, which combined with 2 stacks of Berserker improves chase even more. In case you don’t have energy yet early game or you have to end up breaking a pallet it will be quicker and Wither combined with Berserker basically nullify a survivors chance of gaining any notable distance on you after the hit.
        </p> <p>As for the trait you use with this strategy it comes down to personal preferences but usually Warp or Teleport. As discussed Undead has no cipher control and on larger maps like Moonlit 5 dashes won't be enough for chasing and mobility at the same time. Keep in mind you also have to tunnel the knocked down Survivor who could be anywhere on the map. Teleport and Warp help you do this easily. It also gives you something to get to the gates late game. </p> <p>The reason we don't use anything else is because its questionable or even useless. Excitement is completely useless, because in a charged state you are immune to stuns when swinging anyhow. Peepers are good to help out against looping and tight kiting, but don't give you extra mobility and can be destroyed or simply crawled away from. 
            The healing slow down is also forgettable especially when you consider the fact that you want them to get up so you can down them again to increase their elimination progress by 25%. Undead's hitbox also isn't good enough to warrant using Blink or Patroller. His chase is also good enough to where you shouldn't need it. </p>
            

        
         



    <h1 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h1>

<h1>Arms Factory</h1>

<p>
    This is one of the worst maps you can bring Undead on. There are tons of areas where you can get looped and many high walls and tight spaces make it difficult to optimally use your dashes. The Factory itself adds to these challenges. Some popular and helpful jump chop tricks can be found down below.
</p>

<p> This trick is situational, but can help you catch a Surivivor off guard. It works on some other maps as well like Hospital, Church and Leo's Memory. </p>

  <p> This trick is helpful when a survivor rotates here and is trying to loop you by running around these walls in a circle. You can jump chop to the other side to break the loop.</p>

  <p> This jump chop isn't used often, but it can in theory work and give you a hit or a terror shock.</p>

<p>Jump chopping here fast enough before they vault can be difficult, but can give you terror shocks or hits as well. It's harder to do in high tier where survivors know about these tricks.</p>

<p>You need to try to make the best of an already terrible situation by limiting your risks of getting kited for too long. Don't chase someone in Ruins or Factory first. Try to get a fast down and snowball early game with as many incaps as possible. After that gear up for late game by wasting as many survivor resources as possible. Keeping Teleport for late game gate control is essential to either guarantee a tie or possibly aim for a win.</p>

<h1>Sacred Heart Hospital</h1>
<p>Hospital is probably the worst map ever to bring Undead on. You effectively can't dash in main building or ruins. 
  Other areas are also a pain and there are many walls and loops or tight spaces to play around. 
  These slam spots and jump chops could possibly give you an easier time.</p>

<p>This slam in front or to the sides of bird cage can catch survivors off guard and give you a hit before entering the building. This can potentially end their containment if they're already injured. </p>

  <p>Jump chopping in this area can help break an otherwise annoying position to be looped in. What survivors tend to do is just circle this area without you being able to dash.</p>

<h1>Red Church</h1>
<p>Arguably the best small map for Undead that can be made to work once you've gotten used to his playstyle. You can block off most annoying loops with Confined Space.</p>

<p>This jump chop cuts off an otherwise annoying loop around this area. It works in both directions.</p>

<h1>Leo's Memory</h1>

<p>Leo's Memory is a great map to bring Undead on, since the main building is easily navigated with dashes and the outside area isn't too bad either. 
</p>

<p>You can use this jump chop to catch survivors off guard.</p>

  <p>Even if this jump chop hits nothing you'll still save a ton of time and quickly catch up for potential hit.</p>

  <p>Just like on Red Church and Hospital this shack can be Jump Chopped inside of, but it's pretty strict and highly unlikely you will land a hit.</p>

<h1>Lakeside Village</h1>
<p>Lakeside is a good map for Undead and pretty fun to play on, because of just how many jump chop spots there are. There's plenty of open space.</p>

<p> You can try slamming here in Big Boat to catch survivors off guard.</p>

  <p> There are a lot more Jump Chops than shown here. This is just to give you an idea of how and where they work. Practice makes perfect! By playing lots of matches and practicing you'll automatically learn new stuff on your own.</p>

<h1>Moonlit River Park and Chinatown</h1>
<p>Not a lot to say about these maps, because they have so much open space for dashes and jump chops. Just try to get a feel for the distance and what translates to a hit and what doesn't. For Moonlit keep in mind that you can jump chop up the ledges of the coaster stops and for Chinatown down the buildings. These are two maps where Teleport or Warp are a must so you can easily proxy camp. These maps are overall good maps to bring Undead on.</p>

<p>For first stop you can gain access to the platform easily with a jump chop.</p>

<p>This slam can work, but sometimes they just insta  vault it so you have to be quick about it. Keep in mind im positioned like this so you actually see where we are on the map. You should ideally slam as soon as you reach the top of the stairway.</p>

<h1>Eversleeping Town</h1>
<p>Commonly agreed to be the best map for Undead it features tons of open space and few tight spaces or loops to work with for survivors.</p>

<p>Undead can also counter the tram if survivors decide to use it. The slam works well in lots of other areas too for example this two pallet one window area if they drop it and you time your slam.</p>

  <h1 id="supporting-material">Gameplay</h1>

<p>Because of Undead’s unique way of eliminating survivors, his gameplay is also just as unique. Since he starts with five dashes, your primary objective is to use those to find, start, and end your first chase as quickly as possible. With area selection mode in mind, you should choose your first target wisely and not chase in areas where you know kiting Undead is easy, or a Survivor who has an easy time doing so — or both. Common examples include Factory or Ruins on Arms Factory, the main building on Hospital or Ruins, the back gate area on Red Church, Shack or Ruins on Lakeside, or any high-walled area on Moonlit. In general, you have more leeway on larger maps that are more open and therefore much harder to rotate around, especially against an Undead. Once you have the slam or full presence, chasing in these areas becomes a lot easier. </p>
  

<p>  Ideally, you’d take a look at the team composition before the match starts and see if there are any direct counters already. Just chase those. Otherwise, opt for weaker characters, fast decoders, transitional kiters, distance-pulling survivors, or raw kiters. Try to stay away from areas in which you could be easily tight-kited or looped and don't chase survivors who can easily eat up single hits or make your first chase take a minute. You can find Undead’s counters and popular bans further down below. If there are no direct counters or easy chases, just pick the weakest link in the chain and settle for a decent enough area to chase in.
As Undead doesn’t camp, he saves the time needed to pick up and chair survivors, but this comes at the heavy cost of the elimination speed being slow. So, after you incapacitate your first target, you need to immediately chase your next one. Nobody is going to rescue them; they're going to rescue themselves with Exit Path after about 30 seconds on average. This time varies depending on the actual Survivor you down, as some survivors have faster or slower than average self-heal speeds. If you put a Peeper down or they have Sticker, this can vary even more, so make sure to have a rough idea of survivor self-heal speeds.</p>

<p>Try to stay closer to the Survivor you incapacitated if possible. Don’t face camp, but if they accidentally rotated into a teammate who’s decoding or you’re already near a shaking cipher, just dash to it and begin chasing your next target, ideally downing them too. This brings you to the core of Undead’s gameplay: juggling and micromanaging different surrogates at once while tunneling the one you want to get rid of by means of proxy camping. Once they get up, depending on how much of a distance there is between you and them, you can use Warp, Teleport, or ideally just dash to them to down them again to confirm them. They reveal their location to you anyway, and you’ll see them highlighted, so you’ll know where they are for a brief moment, even if they crawled to some other place.</p>

<p>Now keep this pace going aggressively and continuously check the shaking ciphers and cut off potential “rescuers” who go to your incapacitated target with the intention of healing them because their Exit Path is used up. Teleport is handy for this, as well as Warp. If you’re successful in your endeavors, you’ll snowball and win the match. If it’s getting close to the end game, make sure to save Teleport for it and ensure that you defend the last cipher that’s being primed in an effort to secure the last down you need to increase your odds of winning. If you decide to bring Trump Card, this would be the time to switch to either Abnormal or Teleport depending on the situation. With Detention active, prioritize targeting survivors who you know to be on a death state and who you have incapacitated sufficient times. Keep them from opening the gates at all costs, because as soon as those are open, survivors can just leave by crawling out of them.</p>


<p>Below you can watch a video that covers early, mid and late game in a high tier Undead match on Hospital. Feel free to read the analysis.</p>

<p>Chasing Forward first can be a good choice, as usually in NAEU their playerbases kill level is subpar at best; however, this wasn't the case with this Forward. He uses his item well in order to microball (basically flywheel) any chance of a hit and tight kited. This leads to a 3 cipher kite on his end.</p>

<p>However, he uses up his full ball and for some reason, Novelist decides to support him. This was a big mistake, as supporting against Undead is usually never a good idea. With the Undead charged and a failed flywheel from Novelist, two people are now injured. Journalist also decides to give away a free hit instead of decoding the last two ciphers with Acrobat.</p>

<p>With Novelist going down and Forward deciding to heal instead of decoding, the snowball ist set in motion. Journalist goes down and Forward, instead of decoding, primes his healing. Novelist makes the same mistake twice, giving a no-attack recovery drop-down hit.</p>

<p>With two people "dead on chair," the Undead desperately tries to defend the cipher but to no avail. However, he's clever enough to save his Teleport for late game, in an attempt to turn the match around.</p>

<p>Since Forward didn't bring Borrowed Time, Acrobat, for some reason, decides to heal him. This leaves no one at the gate to prime it post-pop and gives Undead enough time to eliminate the Novelist, who was already dead on chair. Since he transitions to Shack, Undead knows nobody is at this gate and teleports to the other one, finding Journalist and instantly eliminating her with a precise slam and Detention hit. She should've used Flywheel and not wasted all of her items.</p>

<p>This match is a great example of why you should never underestimate late game and the mistakes you've made. In this case, they came back to haunt both Journalist and Novelist, costing Forward and Acrobat their match. Instead of running around healing and supporting, they should've focused on decoding and made sure someone was at the gate to open it quickly instead of all of them being in or around middle.</p>
