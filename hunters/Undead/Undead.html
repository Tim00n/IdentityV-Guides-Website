        <h1 id="classification">Classification and Type</h1>
        <p>Undead is a pure chase single hit hunter. Not only can he quickly traverse the map with his five dashes, but use them in chase to land hits or close distance quickly. Because of his ability to chase so well, he isn't allowed to camp at all and has basically no cipher control.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/UndeadType.png" alt="Undead Chase">
        </div>
        <p>As a formidable chase hunter he's both capable and forced to end chases quickly in an attempt to snowball. His abilities enable him to do this, making it hard to transition against or kite him in open areas. However, he is easily tight kited and looped as well as rushed.</p>

        <h1 id="external-traits">External Traits and Abilities</h1>
        <p>Undead has a few external traits and abilities in his kit that he can use to his advantage.</p>
        <p> Energy Charge is Undead's main trait besides Surrogate. It allows him to increase his Energy Load by using his abilities, which further enhances them. From 0-49 energy this simply does nothing and counts as "Uncharged". However, once the meter is between 50-99 Undead will enter an energy surge state during which his regular attack can break pallets and can't be interrupted. Both of his abilities will also be enhanced significantly. If his energy reaches 100 he will overload, which decreases movement speed by 8% and locks all abilities for 14 seconds.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Energy Charge.png" alt="Energy Charge">
        </div>
      <p>This means you can't get stunned by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pallets</li>
            <li>Cricket balls (Batter)</li>
            <li>Flare guns (Lucky Guy/Coordinator)</li>
            <li>Paintings (Painter)</li>
            <li>Stacks (Enchantress)</li>
            <li>Bees (Entomologist)</li>
            <li>Lasso (Cowboy)</li>
            <li>Magnets (Prospector)</li>
            <li>Flute (Antiquarian)</li>
            <li>Memory Fragment (Little Girl)</li>
            <li>Nitre Bombs (Acrobat)</li>
            <li>Scale (Professor)</li>
            <li>Sketchbook (Novelist)</li>
            <li>Zap (Prisoner)</li>
            <li>Flashlight (Thief)</li>
            <li>Rugby Ball (Forward)</li>
   
        </ul>
            
   
            
            <p>Note that this only applies when you are swinging, i.e., using your regular hit or one of the abilities and are in an energy surge state (50-99 energy). You can and will get stunned by all of these if you do not swing or do so improperly.</p>
            
            <p>Another essential ability to understand is Surrogate. Undead is the only hunter in IDV not able to chair or pick up a survivor at all. Instead, he only downs them to bleed them out, a process known as slugging.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/Surrogate.png" alt="Surrogate Ability">
            </div>
            
            <p>This has many disadvantages but also a few advantages. It's important to keep in mind that every time a survivor is knocked down, elimination progress is increased by 25%. During this time, survivors can use up their self-heal once while their crawling speed is increased by 100%. Something to note is that this stacks with Sticker and counters Peepers because you can effectively crawl out of their radius fast enough.</p>
            
            <p>Surrogate also has a special effect, which increases the speed at which survivors bleed out by 300% when all of them are knocked down and when the gate is activated. It is important to keep in mind that this can stack up to 600%.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/600chair.png" alt="600% Chair">
            </div>
            
            
            <p>His last external trait, Frequency Conversion, lets Undead change the dungeon. It's completely random and should be used carefully.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/Frequency Conversion.png" alt="Frequency Conversion">
            </div>
            
        <p>It exposes his own location to the survivors who will also be notified as to where the new dungeon spawns. Undead isn't and he can't cancel once activated. This is the main reason as to why it is insanely difficult to 4 man eliminate all survivors as Undead. 
            Usually you will always have at least one escape. Another very important thing to keep in mind is that survivors can just run up to the dungeon while its being changed or crawl to it and jump inside to escape without Undead being able to do anything about it. This can be seen here:</p>

          </video>
          
        <p>As for his abilities Undead starts the game with 5 dashes  that deal damage upon hitting the survivor. Undead cannot control his dash unlike Smiley Face and it will end upon hitting a survivor, object or if the maximum distance is reached. It's important to keep in mind that dashes aren't effected by Detention.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Kinetic Dash Hit.png" alt="Dash Ability">
        </div>
        <p>Every dash increases energy by 10. 5 dashes gets you to a charged state and energy level of 50. During this state his abilities are enhanced as desribed above. 
            You can now jump chop hit or double slam survivors with the same abilities. This heavily improves your chase and allows you to pull off certain tricks otherwise not possible. 
        It's suggested to tweak your jump chop sensitivity settings and also turning on the translucent container setting, since Undead's model is quite large.
        </p>
        <p>Go to Settings>SFX>Characters then switch to Undead to adjust it to your liking.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/UndeadSetting1.png" alt="Energy Conversion">
        </div>

        <p>Go to Settings>Controls>Characters then switch to Undead and turn this setting on.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/UndeadSettings2.png" alt="Jump Chop Sensitivity">
        </div>



        <p>The other ability is his charged strike, which is an AOE ranged attack that effects an area and increases in size the longer the button is held for. </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Charged Strike.png" alt="Charged Strike Ability">
        </div>
        <p>If it exceeds a certain threshhold the slam does damage. It also increases energy load by 20 so do not slam if your energy levels are 80+ unless you can warrant overloading. If your energy levels are 50+ then you can slam twice in a row. </p>
        
        <p>Try to set up slams just before a Survivor vaults or drops a pallet. If they are stuck in the vaulting or dropping animation the hit will be guaranteed unless they flywheel it. If you know that they have flywheel you can purposefully bait it out by charging the slam all the way to the maximum or instantly slam without charging long so as to hit them before they even use it. Slams are covered in more detail down below with map specific examples.

          A neat trick you should use is the bottom left points indication on your screen. It confirms whether or not your slam hit by displaying points. 
          
          <div class="image-container">

          <img src="./assets/Pointsnotif.png" alt="Points Notification">
        </div>

          <p> This can save you tons of time and stops the survivor from gaining much if any distance on you, because of the slams otherwise long windup animation. If you don't see the notification you can just stop the ability.</p>

        <p>His last ability unlocks at full presence and simply lets him manage energy levels better. If you are below 50 you will jump to 50. It can also help you decrease your energy by 50 if necessary to prevent overcharge. This is often done between phases, meaning you use it when you are about to enter a chase so you can instantly break pallets and not get stunned or to decrease energy levels so you can dash normally again without overcharging. </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./assets/Energy Conversion.png" alt="Energy Conversion">
        </div>
        <p>Overall, his abilities reflect a fast, agile, aggressive chase style focusing on quickly finishing chases.</p>

        <h1 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h1>
        <p>In this section different Persona Webs and Traits are discussed, which represent different strategies and playstyles. The recommend Persona Web for Undead is a Confined Space Detention build.  
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./assets/Undead Persona.png" alt="Persona Web">
            </div>
        </p> <p>When making a Persona Web you always want to consider the hunters strengths and weaknesses. In Undeads case his strengths are apparent. As we know he doesn't have any camping abilities so points in these traits would be wasted.</p> <p>The reason why we bring Detention is because it can help Undead out a ton late game. While his dashes aren’t effected by it, you can use the dash to close distance and then a regular hit for an instant down. Detention is also justified, because the elimination speed is increased by 300% up to 600% after the gates are activated and if every survivor is knocked down. This gives the player a last chance to secure a tie or possibly turn a tie game into a win.
            The main reason Confined Space is used is because of its prerequisites and because Undead due to his horrible regular hitbox and kit gets looped and tight kited very easily. He can counter transitioning survivors or fast survivors well, but as soon as you start looping him around high walls or tight spaces he can't use his dashes properly and is forced to walk up to you and hit you. Confined Space puts a stop to this by blocking windows, which can enable these loops in the first place. It also gives you 3 stacks of Wither and Pallet Breaking, which combined with 2 stacks of Berserker improves chase even more. In case you don’t have energy yet early game or you have to end up breaking a pallet it will be quicker and Wither combined with Berserker basically nullify a survivors chance of gaining any notable distance on you after the hit.
        </p> <p>As for the trait you use with this strategy it comes down to personal preferences but usually Warp or Teleport. As discussed Undead has no cipher control and on larger maps like Moonlit 5 dashes won't be enough for chasing and mobility at the same time. Keep in mind you also have to tunnel the knocked down Survivor who could be anywhere on the map. Teleport and Warp help you do this easily. It also gives you something to get to the gates late game. </p> <p>The reason we don't use anything else is because its questionable or even useless. Excitement is completely useless, because in a charged state you are immune to stuns when swinging anyhow. Peepers are good to help out against looping and tight kiting, but don't give you extra mobility and can be destroyed or simply crawled away from (keep in mind survivors crawl faster when downed). 
            The healing slow down is also forgettable especially when you consider the fact that you want them to get up so you can down them again to increase their elimination speed by another 25%. Undead's hitbox also isn't good enough to warrant using Blink or Patroller. His chase is also good enough to where you shouldn't need it. Some Undead's do use an alternative build that features Trump Card instead of Confined Space. </p>
            
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./assets/Undead2.png" alt="Undead Peepers Persona Web">
    </div>
            <p>This lets them switch from their primary trait (Peepers, Abnormal or Warp) to whatever you need. This increases flexibility and can help create wins or secure ties, but it costs 30 persona points, which aren’t ever really properly utilized unlike Wither and the faster pallet breaking speeds. If you start with Teleport the only viable switch is Abnormal for the last cipher, but it locks you into this Trait and can be too situational on larger maps, where the distance between ciphers even with five dashes is simply too large. If you start with Peepers they can slow down healing, provide cipher pressure and help out with looping and tight kiting. However, they reduce your mobility, since you won’t have Teleport or Warp and they can be removed or crawled away from easily.
                You can adjust and try out both of these to your liking to see what fits best to your playstyle.</p>





    <h1 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h1>
    <div class="image-container">


</div>

<h1>Arms Factory</h1>

<p>
    This is one of the worst maps you can bring Undead on. There are tons of areas where you can get looped and many high walls and tight spaces make it difficult to optimally use your dashes. The Factory itself adds to these challenges.
</p>

<p>
    Some popular and helpful jump chop tricks can be found in the videos below:
</p>

<p> This trick is situational, but can help you catch a Surivivor off guard. It works on some other maps as well like Hospital, Church and Leo's Memory. </p>

<video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/Shack.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  </video>

  <p> This trick is helpful when a survivor rotates here and is trying to tight kite loop you by running around this area in a circle. You can jump chop to the other side to break the loop.</p>

  <video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/ArmsFactoryJumpChop.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <p> This jump chop isn't used often, but it can in theory work and give you a hit or a terror shock.</p>

  <video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/ArmsRuinsJumpChop.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<p>Jump chopping here fast enough before they vault can be difficult, but can give you terror shocks or hits as well. It's harder to do in high tier where survivors know about these tricks.</p>
  <video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/JumpChop5.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  </video>


<p>You need to try to make the best of an already terrible situation by limiting your risks of getting kited for too long. Do not chase someone in ruins or factory first. Try to get a fast down and snowball early game with as many incaps as possible. After that gear up for late game by wasting as many survivor resources as possible. Keeping Teleport for late game gate control is essential to either guarantee a tie or possibly aim for a win. Just keep in mind that in higher tier it is insanely difficult to even tie on Arms or Hospital so if you win you can definitely pat yourself on the back.</p>

<h1>Sacred Heart Hospital</h1>
<p>Hospital is probably the worst map ever to bring Undead on. You effectively can't dash in main building or ruins. Other areas are also a pain and there are many walls and loops or tight spaces to play around.</p>

<p>These slam spots and jump chops could possibly give you an easier time:</p>

<p>This slam in front or to the sides of bird cage can catch survivors off guard and give you a hit before entering the building. This can potentially end their containment if they are already injured. Try to time it precisely or during their animation of dropping the pallet.</p>

<video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/BirdCageSlam.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <p>You can also try using this slam inside of the main building to catch survivors off guard quickly. Learn how to get creative with this.</p>

  <p>Jump chopping in this area can help break an otherwise annoying position to be looped in. What survivors tend to do is just circle this area without you being able to dash.</p>

  <p> Like on Arms Factory, this Shack can be jumped inside of, but it's not easy to pull off, because of the narrow window frame.</p>

<h1>Red Church</h1>
<p>Arguably the best small map for Undead that can be made to work the more experience you have with him. You can block Church's main windows with Confined Space and also other loops or the Shack Area.</p>
<p>It doesn't have that many jump spots, but this one can come in handy.</p>

<h1>Leo's Memory</h1>

<p>Leo's Memory is a great map to bring Undead on, since the main building is easily navigated with dashes and the outside area isn't too bad either. 
</p>

<p>You can use this jump chop to catch survivors off guard.</p>
<video width="600" controls>
    <source src="./assets/JumpChop3.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <p>Even if this jump chop hits nothing you will still save a ton of time and quickly catch up for potential hit.</p>

<h1>Lakeside Village</h1>
<p>Lakeside is a good map for Undead and pretty fun to play on, because of just how many jump chop spots there are. There's plenty of open space.</p>

<p> Here are some slam and jump chop spots to help you out: </p>

<p> You can try using this one in Big Boat to catch survivors off guard.</p>

<h1>Moonlit River Park and Chinatown</h1>
<p>Not a lot to say about these maps, because they have so much open space for dashes and jump chops. Just try to get a feel for the distance and what translates to a hit and what doesn't. For Moonlit keep in mind that you can jump chop up the ledges of the coaster stops and for Chinatown down the buildings.</p>
<p> These are two maps where Teleport or Warp are a must so you can easily proxy camp. These maps are overall good maps to bring Undead on.</p>

<p>For first stop you can  gain access to the platform easily when charged as can be seen here:</p>

<p>This slam can work, but sometimes they just insta  vault it so you have to be quick about it. Keep in mind im positioned like this so you actually see where we are on the map. You should ideally slam as soon as you reach the top of the stairway.</p>

<h1>Eversleeping Town</h1>
<p>Commonly agreed to be the best map for Undead it features tons of open space and few tight spaces or loops to work with for survivors.</p>

<p>Undead can also counter the tram if survivors do decide to use it. The slam works well in lots of other areas too for example this two pallet one window area if they drop it and you charge slam mid animation:</p>

<h1 id="supporting-material">Gameplay</h1>

<p>Because of Undead’s unique way of eliminating survivors, his game plan is also just as unique. Since he starts with five dashes, your primary objective is to use those to find, start, and end your first chase as quickly as possible. With area selection mode in mind, you should choose your first target wisely and not chase in areas where you know kiting Undead is easy, or a character that has an easy time doing so — or both. Common examples include Factory or Ruins on Arms Factory, the main building on Hospital or Ruins, the back gate area on Red Church, Shack or Ruins on Lakeside, or any high-walled area on Moonlit. In general, you have more leeway on larger maps that are more open and therefore much harder to rotate around, especially against an Undead. Once you have the slam or full presence, chasing in these areas becomes a lot easier. Ideally, you’d take a look at the team composition before the match starts and see if there are any direct counters already. Just chase those. Otherwise, opt for weaker characters, fast decoders, transitional kiters, distance-pulling survivors, or raw kiters. Try to stay away from areas in which you could be easily tight-kited or looped or where characters can easily eat up single hits. You can find Undead’s counters and popular bans further down below. If there are no direct counters or easy chases, just pick the weakest link in the chain and settle for a decent enough area to chase in.</p>

<p>As Undead doesn’t camp, he saves the time needed to pick up and chair survivors, but this comes at the heavy cost of the elimination speed being slow. So, after you incapacitate your first target, you need to immediately chase your next one. Nobody is going to rescue them; they're going to rescue themselves with Exit Path after about 30 seconds on average. This time varies depending on the actual Survivor you down, as some survivors have faster or slower than average self-heal speeds. If you put a Peeper down or they have Sticker, this can vary even more, so make sure to have a rough idea of survivors' self-heal speeds.</p>

<p>Try to stay closer to the Survivor you incapacitated if possible. Don’t face camp, but if they accidentally rotated into a teammate who’s decoding or you’re already near a shaking cipher, just dash to it and begin chasing your next target, ideally downing them too. This brings you to the core of Undead’s gameplay: juggling and micromanaging different surrogates at once while tunneling the one you want to get rid of by means of proxy camping. Once they get up, depending on how much of a distance there is between you and them, you can use Warp, Teleport, or ideally just dash to them to down them again to confirm them. They reveal their location to you anyway, and you’ll see them highlighted, so you’ll know where they are for a brief moment, even if they crawled to some other place.</p>

<p>Now keep this pace going aggressively and continuously check the shaking ciphers and cut off potential “rescuers” who go to your incapacitated target with the intention of healing them because their Exit Path is used up. Teleport is handy for this, as well as Warp. If you’re successful in your endeavors, you’ll snowball and win the match. If it’s getting close to the end game, make sure to save Teleport for it and ensure that you defend the last cipher that’s being primed in an effort to secure the last down you need to increase your odds of winning. If you decide to bring Trump Card, this would be the time to switch to either Abnormal or Teleport depending on the situation. With Detention active, prioritize targeting survivors who you know to be on a death state and who you have incapacitated sufficient times. Keep them from opening the gates at all costs, because as soon as those are open, survivors can just leave by crawling out of them.</p>

<p>As Undead, the first chase is crucial and sets the tone for the rest of the match. In theory, you can chase any survivor first, but you should prioritize fast decoders or weaker targets to help you easily snowball.</p>

<p>Chasing Forward first can be a good choice, as usually in NAEU their players' skill level is subpar at best; however, this wasn't the case with this Forward. He used his item well in order to microball (basically flywheel) any chance of a hit and tight kited. This led to a 3 cipher kite on his end.</p>

<p>However, he used up his full ball, and for some reason, Novelist decided to support him. This was their first big mistake, as supporting against Undead is usually never a good idea.</p>

<p>With the Undead charged and a failed flywheel from Novelist, two people were now injured. Journalist also decided to give away a free hit instead of decoding the last two ciphers like Acrobat.</p>

<p>With Novelist going down and Forward deciding to heal instead of decoding, the snowball was set in motion. Journalist went down, and Forward, instead of decoding, primed his healing. Novelist made the same mistake twice, giving a no-attack recovery drop-down hit.</p>

<p>With two people "dead on chair," the Undead desperately tried to defend the cipher but to no avail. He was clever enough to save his teleport for late game though, so he could turn the match around according to plan.</p>

<p>Since Forward didn't bring Borrowed Time, Acrobat, for some reason, decided to heal him. This left no one at the gate to prime it post-pop and gave Undead enough time to eliminate the Novelist, who was already dead on chair. Since he transitioned to Shack, Undead knew nobody was at this gate and teleported to the other one, finding Journalist and instantly eliminating her with a precise slam and Detention hit. She should have flywheeled.</p>

<p>The others skirmished around, but with no gates opened, they were also eliminated.</p>

<p>This match is a great example of why you should never underestimate late game and the mistakes you've made. In this case, they came back to haunt both Journalist and Novelist, costing Forward and Acrobat their match. Instead of running around healing and supporting, they should've focused on decoding and made sure someone was at the gate to open instead of all of them in the middle.</p>
