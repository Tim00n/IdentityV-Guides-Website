        <h1 id="classification">Classification and Type</h1>
        <p> Hermit is a mixture between a chase hunter and control hunter, outputting formidable damage with presence and having an automatic control mechanism that reduces and distributes decoding progress. His ability to share damage to all survivors of the same polarity can create remarkable map pressure, forcing survivors to heal each other in order to rescue and kite.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063282/HermitStatistics_rrsoxm.png" alt="Hermit Chart">
        </div>
        <p> The biggest downside of Hermit is his slow early game, as he starts with no mobility and a decently long cooldown on his first ability. As such, Hermit is a hunter that relies on snowballing to win through distributing as much damage as possible. There are a few tactics to achieve this goal, whether it is by expediting the first chase or causing enough damage to offset cipher rush.  
        </p>

        <h1 id="external-traits">External Traits and Abilities</h1>
        <p> Hermit's external trait "Blessing" has multiple components. The most basic aspect is that it allows Hermit to deal 1.2x basic attack damage, which allows you to instantly down Merc if he is terrorshocked or hit with detention (provided he does not have a charge.) You will still receive the regular amount of presence from a hit (500).
        </p>
        <p> The subtrait "Bestow" applies a red charge to any survivors that touch a cipher machine or exit gate within Hermit's circuits.
        </p>
        <p> Finally, the subtrait "Convert" allows survivors actively touching a cipher to change their polarity once every 100 seconds. This is used by the survivors to either share damage with the kiter to prolong their survival, or avoid taking damage if the kiter will be downed soon. There is a 50-second window at the start of the match before this can be used.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063281/Blessing_ozpb5g.png" alt="Blessing">
        </div>

        <p> The second external trait "Selfishness" is what causes damage to be shared across all survivors of the same charge. A survivor that is wirelessly damaged with this trait will not be Terror Shocked while interacting with an object, although it will still interrupt actions like healing or decoding. However, it should be noted that someone who is Terror Shocked in chase will distribute twice the damage to everyone on the same polarity. (For example, a hit distributed across 4 survivors would usually deliver 0.3x damage each, but with a Terror Shock the number would increase to 0.6x)
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063278/Selflessness_u62tin.png" alt="Selfishness">
        </div>

        <p> When a survivor of a certain polarity is damaged, all survivors of that polarity have their charge removed after receiving damage. This is the most common way that a charge is removed. However, other methods include:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Entering lockers</li>
                <li>Perfumes (Before gaining polarity, to remove polarity)</li>
                <li>Perfumes (With polarity, removes charge after being hit and recalling)</li>
                <li>Gravekeeper entering shovel</li>
                <li>LG leeching</li>
                <li>Any method that causes incapacitation (including Psychologist whistling someone and becoming downed)</li>
            </ul>

        
        <p>Before discussing Hermit's chase abilities, it is important to discuss some of his basic utilities that are available to him at 0 presence. His first ability, "Meditation", allows him to connect up to 5 cipher machines in a circuit. When decoding one cipher machine, 50% of decoding progress remains in that machine, 42% is distributed to the other ciphers in the system, and 8% is voided. The same effect can also be applied to Exit Gates.</p>

        <p> Once a circuit is created, the ability goes on a 60 second cooldown. At any time, the current circuit can be disconnected entirely, which does not alter the cooldown. A cipher locked off with hunter persona "Constain" can also be connected to this circuit.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063280/Meditation_xstn2f.png" alt="Meditation">
        </div>

        <p> Hermit also has an ability called "Reverse Polarity", which allows him to switch the polarity of his stuns without cooldown. It should be noted that he usually cannot perform this ability while stuck in an interaction, such as vaulting a window, carrying a survivor, or undergoing attack recovery. However, he can switch polarities during the "Attachment" ability, which will be discussed soon.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063281/ReversePolarity_snodch.png" alt="Reverse Polarity">
        </div>

        <p> Hermit's one and only chase ability at 0 presence, "Miracle", fires a straight-moving projectile in the camera's direction. This ability has a 12 second cooldown per charge. When hitting an object, the orb will create a flat electromagnetic field on the floor, with the center at the point of contact. This means that if the projectile contacts a wall, the field will be placed at that location, but on the floor; the center cannot float off the ground. If the survivor steps in this field, two actions can occur:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the survivor has no polarity, the polarity of the field will be applied to them.</li>
            <li>If the field is of the opposite polarity, the survivor will be pulled to the center of the field and stunned for 2/2/0.5 seconds if they are stunned 1/2/3+ times in short succession.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> If the field is of the same polarity, it will have no effect. The pulling effect of the stun allows Hermit to hit the survivor through a window if they are pulled against it closely. Additionally, if the survivors use the "Flywheel" trait on a field that would stun them, it destroys the field. The stunning effect can also be cancelled by certain survivor abilities, such as Norton's magnet.
        </p>
        <p> It should also be mentioned that hitting a survivor directly with the projectile will not create a field, but applies the same logic on the survivor, stunning them in place rather than pulling them. This allows you to perform actions such as stunning Toy Merchant during flight, though this is difficult in practice.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">

        <p> At max presence, Hermit will be able to store 2 uses of "Miracle".

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <p> Once Hermit gains first presence, he gains the ability "Attachment", which has a 40 second cooldown per charge. Using this ability gives him a 4-second window where he has a higher view and can fire a straight-moving projectile in the camera's direction. This projectile passes through walls and teleports Hermit where it lands. If the area targeted is not valid, the projectile will land at the closest area to Hermit in that direction, not the closest area to the target itself. There are a few interesting gimmicks involving this ability:
        <ul>
            <li>Unlike with "Miracle" projectiles, the survivors are shown an area in which the projectile will land.</li>
            <li>If Hermit is at an elevation when using this ability, the max range is significantly increased based on the height of the platform.</li>
            <li>"Reverse Polarity" can be used after activating "Attachment" to change the polarity before launching.</li>
            <li>"Miracle" can be used during the 4-second window of "Attachment". Not only does this lack the usual animation of firing a "Miracle" orb, but it also lacks the warning boundary of "Attachment". This can be used to apply two polarities at once.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Be warned that "Attachment" can be cancelled by stun/control effects at any time before the "Attachment" orb hits the ground. This will waste a usage of the ability, and you will remain in your original location.
        </p>

        </p>

        </div>

        <p>In summary, Hermit's kit leaves you with a slow early game, but can quickly become oppressive late-game if developed. The transition from low to high presence can be made smoother with the persona traits discussed below.</p>

        <h1 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h1>
        <p>In this section different Persona Webs and Traits are discussed, which represent different strategies and playstyles. There are two main builds for Hermit, but the most popular one is the Insolence-Detention build.

        </p>
        <p> You will see most Hermit players use this build, since it directly addresses the issue of his slow first chase when it comes to gaining presence. By using Insolence, it allows you to gain "Attachment" sooner, which is a crucial tool when it comes to countering transition-kiters and pallet spam. Depending on which strategy you use, you may also end up with max presence directly on your first down, which helps apply early pressure on the survivors. Since Hermit leverages his late game quite often, you don't want to remove Detention, as many other Final Talents do not benefit him in any comparable way.
        </p>
        <p> Regarding his passives outside of Final Talent branches, those can be adjusted according to your preferences and the line-up. It is good to include Constrain regardless, because it synergizes well with his circuits; at the start of the match, you spawn at one cipher, then can connect 5 and leave the constrained cipher outside of the circuit. This allows all survivors to be affected by the circuit, or forces them to rotate more early game before decoding. Wither and to an extent Berserker are good traits which allow you to get multiple hits on a rescuer, which can be crucial to slow down decoding. Use of Destructiveness can vary; you normally want to pack around 2 stacks in smaller maps, but can get away with 1 or even none if you need another trait like Mischevious to deal with harassers.
        </p>
        <p> In terms of traits, there are three which are used with this build.
        </p>
        <p> Warp is the most common trait used on Hermit, serving as a means to close distance, catch a survivor off guard, or get an extra hit on someone decoding while there is a survivor chaired nearby. This trait arguably has the best synergy with Hermit, because it makes his early chases more bearable, while allowing for a degree of map control at all stages of the game. The main downside is that the 60m distance is not enough to get from one gate to another. Additionally, one must be more careful using it in smaller maps, due to the amount of map objects that might hinder its utility.
        </p> 
        <p> Teleport is also a semi-popular trait that tends to be chiefly used in larger maps. This is a somewhat risky strategy, as you lack chase traits, and teleporting to the wrong cipher can ruin the match. However, packing Teleport does give you insurance for late-game, since you are able to teleport to gates easily to secure at least one extra elimination. The Teleport strategy is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hermit chases the first available target, regardless of who it is.
            </li>
            <li>
                The target is chased until there are diminishing returns from chasing. One should aim to hit the target at least once, or waste enough items before teleporting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although all ciphers will shake in a circuit, those with a survivor actively decoding will shake slightly more. If you have spawn select, make a prediction on the most vulnerable survivor's position based on that information, and teleport to the relevant cipher.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is 1 cipher remaining, you know for certain that the last cipher machine is not primed (ideally under 80%), and you have just chaired a survivor, you can teleport to the cipher being primed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The Teleport strategy leverages the fact that when a survivor touches a cipher, they gain a polarity. By teleporting, it ensures that you can get hits on more survivors early game, rather than having to apply two polarities to a target without one.
        </p>
        <p> Although less popular after Warp was released, Blink can also be used on Hermit to secure a stable tie. The upside of Blink is that you can use it to easily hit a survivor without needing to use your ability to prevent teammates from sharing damage and wasting too much time. However, this comes with the huge downside of not being able to counter transitional lineups; since you need to be close to the survivor to blink, good rotation will leave you at a huge time loss. This trait is only recommended in small maps like Arms Factory if you're forced to chase in strong kiting areas and are unable to land your abilities easily.
        </p>
        <p> Another common Hermit build is the Trumpcard-Detention build, which also has various utilities.

        <p>Unlike with the Insolence-Detention build, you will have to rely on your 0 presence ability and trait to get the 2 hits required for "Attachment". This does hurt your early game, but the main tradeoff is that you invest equally into early and late game, as you're able to use a chase trait and switch to a control trait rather than being stuck in a control/chase style with the Insolence build.
        </p>

        <p> Having hunter's instinct will help you catch up to the first target easier, although the difference can seem marginal. On the north branch, the passives will remain the same, and you don't particularly need any of the talents on the path to Insolence.
        </p>

        <p> You are able to pack Blink, Warp, or even Excitement as a first trait depending on your needs. Regardless, one should switch to Teleport if the exit gates are expected to activate. It is not recommended to use traits like Peepers, Abnormal, or Patroller at any stage in the game, as they tend to have poor synergy with Hermit's kit.

<h1>Arms Factory</h1>

<p> Arms Factory is likely the worst map for Hermit. 3 corners of the map contain loops with high walls and corners which prevent "Miracle" orbs from having clear line-of-sight to the survivor. This forces you to rely on "Attachment", which can be tricky depending on how much you struggle to get the first hit. In this map, you will most likely benefit from an Insolence build to unlock your chase kit and deal with these areas.
</p>

</div>

<p> Although many areas in Arms Factory make chasing difficult, it is recommended to spawn near the circled areas, as more vulnerable targets will generally spawn there, and the areas have less tricky high walls. Additionally, there is a chance that basement spawns in the location, which would further punish the kiter choosing to stay at the location. While you can chase the survivor in the middle if you are confident, it is normally a waste of time since a stronger kiter will be located there. Ideally you'll want to chase the person at shack (top middle) if given the opportunity; you can make use of moonwalking to catch them off guard for an early first hit by holding the "Miracle" orb ability and turning away from the wall to hide the red light.
</p>

<p> Factory can be a painful place to initially score hits, but there are some tricks to get the initial hit faster. Firstly, it is important to get rid of that initial pallet as fast as possible. This means you should play aggressively around the pallet until you're either pallet stunned or the survivor drops it, after which you can break it. A survivor will normally try to play around the windows of factory, which are hard to interact with due to the many items in the middle of the factory. If they are transitioning to the back window, you can shoot the wall above the window to stun the survivor as they are vaulting it. If you know they have Knee Jerk Reflex, and aren't close enough to score a hit, stunning them after they have vaulted the window can nullify their speedboost and allow you to catch up faster.</p>

<p> If the survivor is rotating to the front window, you can use the same trick to stun them as they vault by shooting the wall above the window from the inside or outside. A key difference with this window is that it is against one mostly straight wall, rather than two walls connected to each other. If the survivor has Knee Jerk Reflex, you can mindgame them by moving back and forth to keep them at the window until their Knee Jerk Reflex is expired, and then stun them at the window.</p>

<h1>Red Church</h1>

<p> Red Church is also an annoying map for Hermit in the early game due to the sheer amount of walls, which counters the line-of-sight aspect of his ability. However, this map relies more on pallets than windows, which opens up some opportunities if you play methodically.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063283/ChurchMapSelect_c80agy.png" alt="Church Map Select">
</div>

<p> If you can catch up to the person at church or shack, it is a good idea to chase them since these are mostly open areas. However, they will normally rotate away before you can catch up, so it is unreliable to rely on those spawns. Chasing the person at red carpet can be a good idea, but be aware if they try to rotate to graveyard or have a stronger kiting kit. The bottom left of the map is considered by a lot of hunters to be a popular trap spot; survivors decoding at the cipher there will be lured into moving to the pallet nearby, which corners them and allows you to score a hit before they enter ruins.</p>

<p> While the left ruins is quite oppressive for Hermit to chase in, the entire right side of the map also tends to waste time due to having lots of high walls and corners. However, there are some gimmicks in certain areas that allows you to make a few loops easier to counter. The main things to remember are that you can shoot some walls to cover pallets, and "Miracle" orbs can travel through the iron bar windows. This allows you to shut down Red Church's "god pallet":</p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p>You can moonwalk in many locations of Red Church to leverage the high walls to your advantage and close more distance. Unfortunately, much like Arms Factory, this map lacks two-story areas which prevents you from jumping around the map easily with "Attachment". However, it is easier to use Warp due to having simpler windows to play around, in order to shut down the church loop or cut off the survivor during transitions.</p>


<h1>Sacred Heart Hospital</h1>
<p> Sacred Heart Hospital can be a difficult map for Hermit, due to hospital and ruins being oppressive areas to chase in. However, there are areas on the map where his kit shines, either due to having low walls or being isolated from other kiting areas.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063279/SarcedHeartHospitalAreaSelection_fcilbx.png" alt="Hospital Map Select">
</div>

<p> The ideal scenario is that someone spawns anywhere on the right side of the map. Try to spawn as close to them as possible (but make sure you're beneath them) in order to cut them off from entering hospital or ruins. Since you have a clear line of sight, it is almost impossible for them to conceal their rotation, allowing for a quick acquisition of a first target. Normal rotation involves the survivor transitioning to shack and then ruins; make sure to get enough damage before they can enter ruins.</p>

<p> Sometimes, survivors will refuse to spawn on the right side for this reason; in which case, a survivor normally spawns at left-middle. You should spawn at one of the corners (depending on your build) and make use of the low walls to be able to stun and injure the survivor before they can exit the statue kiting area. Remember to break the two long pallets closest to statue; you waste more time playing around these than destroying them.</p>

<p> There are a couple mid- to end-game advantages when it comes to Hospital. Firstly, line of sight is fairly good in Hospital, which allows you to see rescuers from afar and get multiple hits before they make it to the chair. Hospital also tends to have a lot of vulnerable ciphers, mainly those that spawn on the bottom or right edges of the map, which allows you to hold those ciphers to prevent exit gate activation. Additionally, you are able to jump from the top of Hospital to most locations in the map. </p>

<h1>Leo's Memory</h1>

<p> Leo's Memory can be a bit of a mixed bag; generally, early game will be difficult due to poor visibility, allowing the survivors to easily rotate to certain areas of the map, especially when it comes to the main building. It is important to catch survivors out of rotation to confirm your first elimination as fast as possible.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063279/LeoMapSelect_zmuzl4.png">
</div>

<p> Per usual, you don't want to chase in a lot of areas with high walls. Similarly to Red Church, you can chase middle or factory if you can catch them off-guard, especially with Warp, but keep in mind that they can usually rotate to second story faster than you can get to them. While it is possible to chase the bottom right of the map, you should make sure it's a decoder or other vulnerable charcater, as the walls are cornered but can waste a lot of time if used correctly. Warp will be a good trait in this map for controlling decoding and cutting off survivors from loops, as besides the top left area, the kiting areas here are sparser than other maps. </p>

<p> The tall two-story building allows you to jump around the map using "Attachment", while also allowing you to have a limited bird's eye view of the survivors and possibly catch them rotating to heal or decode. </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>


<h1>Lakeside Village</h1>

<p> Lakeside Village can be quite a frustrating map for a lot of hunters, due to having so many solid kiting areas and difficult ciphers to lock if the survivors coordinate correctly. The entire area surrounding the small boat tends to be a horrible first chase location, boasting an upgraded T&L wall in the North, a double pallet with high walls in the South, and an abnormally shaped window loop in the middle of it all. Unlike most other maps, the Lakeside shack is abnormally shaped due to having perpendicular entrances and a narrow opening, so it is not recommended to treat it the same way as your usual shack location, especially if you are dealing with a kiter like Acrobat. Your main weak ciphers will be on the third column, top right (shore), and bottom right (pier). </p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063279/LakesideMapSelect_rfhq5j.png" alt="Lakeside Map Select">
</div>

<p> Despite all of the strong kiting areas, there is a tradeoff that the middle of the map tends to be quite empty, allowing you to punish survivors caught in rotation. Similarly, you can generally see where the rescuer is coming from, which is helpful when trying to stuff or punish rescues. Once again, Warp will be the recommended trait to achieve positive results. The advantage of Lakeside is that there are quite a few ways you can use Warp to shut down the small boat and big boat loops.</p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> Additionally, if you manage to chair at the top of the big boat, it is one of the best areas to camp due to having similar gimmicks to basement. All areas (outside and inside ramps) where the survivors can enter to rescue allow you to perform flying hits, while using your ability to keep them in place to avoid flywheel. Having 3 stacks of Wither in your build makes it much easier to get the second stun before the survivor is able to rescue.</p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> It is also an honorable mention that you can jump quite easily from the big boat to other locations on the map.</p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<h1>Eversleeping Town</h1>

<p> While Eversleeping Town is generally a good map for hunters, it doesn't synergize the best with Hermit's kit due to the amount of tall walls, awkward two-story buildings, graveyard and being unable to clearly see the two gates. However, kiting areas are sparsely positioned and have low walls, allowing for easier chases overall once you are able to close distance. </p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063281/EversleepingMapSelect_hksbym.png" alt="Eversleeping Map Select">
</div>

<p> If you manage to catch someone on the top row of the map, this is advantageous as it is hard to stealthily rotate and there is plenty of open area to cause some damage. Be wary of characters like Lawyer, which in coordinated teams will make use of the tall buildings to prevent you from acquiring a first target. While you can use the Warp strategy here as usual, this is a good map for the insolence Teleport strategy, as many ciphers are in vulnerable positions, allowing you to score free hits. This will be a reoccurring theme in the next couple maps discussed.</p>

<p> While there aren't many tricks involving Hermit's kit in this map, you can jump up the 2-story buildings.</p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>


<h1>Chinatown</h1>

<p> Despite having some kiting areas with long walls (everything marked with an X), the huge advantage of this map is the sparse kiting areas, easy line-of-sight in most other locations, and the open nature of the map. This is the only map where the gates have a line-of-sight with each other, which is quite beneficial as it is a small map. Additionally, the middle of the map is very empty, allowing you to see decoders and rescuers from afar. </p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063280/ChinaMapSelect_cnrnhw.png" alt="Chinatown Map Select">
</div>

<p> You are able to perform long jumps from both catwalks on the map (top left, bottom left). </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> Additionally, there are some warp tricks to shut down those kiting in these areas. </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> There isn't too much to discuss in this map, as many of the areas are quite intuitive when it comes to chase. Be aware of Lawyer once again, as there are still tall buildings which will allow survivors to rotate easily early game. </p>

<h1>Moonlit River Park</h1>

<p> Moonlit River Park itself tends to be quite a comfortable and enjoyable map for Hermit, due to the amount of tricks you can perform, the lack of thick walls, and one of the best visibilities of any other map. Unfortunately, this is the map where you will tend to see a lot of strong kiters, and you're stuck with making a difficult decision on who to chase first.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063280/MoonlitMapSelect_dx6dst.png" alt="Moonlit Map Select">
</div>

<p> The first and last rollercoaster stops are generally a terrible place to try hunting, as you will normally see kiters like Aeroplanist, Acrobat and Patient, who can pass through railings and rotate for a long time before using the rollercoaster. The top bridge will also tend to have a really strong kiter, so it is only recommended to commit to chasing this survivor if they aren't a hard counter and you have Warp on hand. This is one of those maps which benefit the greatest from the insolence Teleport strategy, as there are many locations to make long-distance jumps with the "Attachment" ability. </p>

<p> Most commonly, you are able to make long jumps from the second and third stops. </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> Additionally, if you must, you can also jump from the slides which are close by. </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

<p> Although you won't always have the opportunity, Moonlit's second story building does allow you to jump quite far. Your visibility is hindered by the walls, so you'll likely have to guess where the survivors are, or jump to a shaking cipher. </p>

<ul><li>(video)</li></ul>

  <h1 id="supporting-material">Gameplay</h1>

<p> Regardless of what tactic is used, Hermit's early game tends to be slow. Due to the nature of his kit, Hermit mains can opt for both a chase or control style based on their needs. </p>

<h1>Chase Style</h1>
<p> Chasing style tends to be more secure as you would play like a traditional hunter, scoring a first down as fast as possible, and securing a tie at minimum if played correctly. This is usually pursued in the following scenarios: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The map is Arms Factory, Red Church, Sacred Heart Hospital, or some other map with too many kiting areas for a fast chase without assistance. </li>
    <li> The lineup has too many strong kiters, or characters with the ability to waste time and prevent a fast hit if you were to try chasing them. </li>
    <li> There are a lot of harassers/assist characters, and even getting a fast down will be punished without assistance. </li>
</ul>

<p> Hermit is weak against these situations in general, but by focusing your persona web and traits on chase, you can balance out some of these odds. THe most common scenario is that you will have a lineup with many transition-kiters; if you have Warp, you can chase transition characters with limited items or significant cooldowns. Be careful when hunting characters like Forward, or other survivors with dynamic use of their ability, as you can waste Warp by making an incorrect prediction of their distance; only use this trait if you are certain they will not be able to escape you easily. Using traits like Blink and Excitement can be risky, because if you fail to gain value from them, you are left with little to no transitional tools to help you finish your chases.</p>

<p> You normally want to start the game by not connecting ciphers before getting the first hit on your target, as preventing survivors from sharing damage helps secure a faster first down. At this point, you can choose to quickly connect ciphers if you are confident you can get the down fast regardless, or you can not connect the ciphers at all until the down has occurred. Although this does allow them to easily complete the first 3 ciphers, you can then connect the remaining ones to start applying damage and pressure. (Remember to save a circuit for when Exit Gates activate!)</p>

<p> At this point, you'll want to get as much damage on the rescuer as possible. Do not allow a no-damage rescue by any means necessary, as this will prevent you from applying Panic stacks to the decoders, allowing for easy cipher rush. You also cannot usually change targets with this strategy, as once again, cipher rush will allow them to activate exit gates by the time the second survivor's chair is about to expire. The idea is that by using Warp/Blink, and optionally Insolence, you make it very difficult for the rescued individual to rebound kite. Also don't forget that you can choose to disconnect the ciphers before a rescue to prevent damage sharing, as survivors outside of a circuit can't change their polarity. Although it seems like this would be counterintuitive, as it helps them decode faster and leaves them uninjured, you save much more time by getting an elimination faster.</p>

<p> When it comes to the endgame, if you are unable to use a trait to get to gates, then you'll have to focus on getting one last elimination, as Hermit's kit by itself usually cannot guarantee two additional eliminations in that scenario. If you've already found a target, be careful when connecting gates, as this could allow the survivors to bodyblock for their teammate and escape to dungeon. Remember to play patient and bait out flywheel if it is present, as using your resources (especially "Attachment" orbs) too wastefully can be severely punishing.</p>

<p> In summary, playing with a chase style prioritizes the early game, and to a degree mid-game. While this is a safer way to play, one can expect more ties than wins due to Hermit's current viability.</p>

<h1>Control Style</h1>
<p> Although this can be a risky style, it is extremely rewarding when successful, being able to score surprise 4Ks in the right scenarios. Normally, this implies using a build with Insolence and the Teleport trait. There are some scenarios where this tactic is most appropriate: </p>
<ul>
    <li> You are in a large and/or open map, such as Moonlit River Park or Eversleeping Town, which allow you to get quick hits on the survivors you teleport to. </li>
    <li> The lineup isn't fully stable. This means that there are decoders, raw kiters, or assists that have a harder time rotating too far or escaping you. </li>
    <li> There are a lot of rescuers or survivors with Tide Turner, which would normally waste time if you're trying to tunnel one survivor. </li>
</ul>

<p> While your first down technically takes longer, the idea is that you apply as much overall damage as possible, gaining a lot of presence, and being able to chase any target on the map. This works especially well against coordinated teams, as you prevent them from being able to rotate. (Specifics of using the Insolence-Teleport strategy for this purpose are discussed <a href="#persona-web">here</a>).</p>

<p> While there isn't too much to discuss regarding this strategy, you should keep in mind that you're playing for objectives, rather than eliminations. Expendable abilities, injuries, uses of Exit Path, and time used for rotating are all "resources" that you must pressure in order to win with this strategy. Rather than playing as a traditional chase hunter, this makes Hermit into more of a snowball hunter.</p>

<p> Based on your resources and scenario, these styles can be mixed and matched to your needs. Your strategy should adapt to take advantage of weak points in the survivor's lineup and strategy. </p>
