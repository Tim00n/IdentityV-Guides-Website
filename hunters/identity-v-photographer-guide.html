        <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>

        <p>With a difficulty of 2.5/3, Photographer, or Joseph, is one of the 30 available hunters. He has a heavy control aspect and leans more on the complex side due to his strict kit of slowing decoding down and keeping survivors constantly injured. 
          </p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063301/Jojo_Classification_jzchf4.png" alt="Photographer's Strengths and Weaknesses">
    </div>

    <p>  His chase is incredibly weak and is slower than the average hunter. As for his chair camping, he does not have much (especially early game) to heavily prevent a rescue. Due to this, he is not beginner friendly and requires moderate to advanced hunter tactics. However, he does have a quicker attack recovery that nearly covers a full 180° in front.</p>

    <h2 id="traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>

    <p>Joseph’s main trait is the camera world, which he can set up through cameras placed across the map. 
        Once a picture has been taken and the world is set up, everything is considered frozen in place except for him and the survivors who enter. 
       </p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063303/Camera_World_z6sei8.png" alt="Camera World">
    </div>

    <p> Joseph can deal damage through the camera world and when the camera world ends, half the damage will be inflicted in the real world. 
        As for the decoding, the cipher progress between the real and camera world average out, usually cutting back and slowing down decoding.
         Considering his extremely poor chase, Camera World can be seen as a substitute, since clones can't kite him.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063303/Spacetime_ewzhsr.png" alt="Spacetime">
    </div>
    <p>Joseph is one of two hunters who deal more damage with their hits. Instead of the Survivor being at half health after one hit, the survivor will be at 3/4.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063301/Recorded_Moment_vlgrcz.png" alt="Recorded Moment">
    </div>
    <p>Joseph’s first presence allows him to switch between the camera world and real world without needing to walk through a camera. The camera world must be up for this ability to be active.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063302/Time_Jump_p7lztq.png" alt="Time Jump">
    </div>
    <p>Joseph’s second presence gives him a better chance during a chase. Upon unlocking it, Joseph’s last 15 seconds worth of steps are recorded and by holding his card trick ability, he can go back to one of the marked moments. It's crucial Joseph gets this unlocked as soon as possible because it gives him a better chance in a chase while also being able to pressure.</p>

    <h2 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h2>

    <p>Most Josephs typically run an up-right build like this to give him a better performance in game
        overall. Typically, I always invest in Berserker while the comp and map decide the rest. For when
        there’s a doctor on the team, I take one Impact and for harassers typically Rage, Desperate Fight
        and Addiction. If there’s more than one decoder, I’ll usually invest in max Berserker. For Traits, usually start off on Blink and typically switch
        to Teleport later in the game.</p>

    <p>If you’re new to Joseph and want to understand how his kit works in a match, taking Detention
        can secure a Tie or possibly make a Tie a Win depending on how well it’s played. I wouldn’t get
        too used to Joseph with Detention, because he’s extremely weak and it’s better off if
        you learn how to play him with an up-right build from the start. Sometimes on bigger maps with
        really good teams, I take Detention just to secure a Tie. Again, start with Blink then switch to
        Teleport late game.
    Up-down builds with Teleport are okay for extra map control
        but truthfully, Joseph relies on Blink a lot since his chase is non existent.</p>

    <p>Traits Joseph shouldn't use:</p>

        <li>Abnormal</li>
        <li>Peepers</li>
        <li>Patroller</li>
        <li>Warp</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h2>
    <p>Strong maps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Red Church</li>
        <li>Arms Factory</li>
        <li>Eversleeping Town</li>
        <li>Sacred Hospital</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Weak maps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Moonlit Park</li>
        <li>Leo’s Memory</li>
        <li>Chinatown</li>
        <li>Lakeside Village</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the sake of Joseph’s slow movements and nonexistent chase, smaller maps give him an
        advantage in terms of mobility. Personally, I find Sacred Heart Hospital and Ever Sleeping Town tolerable, but that’s just my opinion. It’s important to know spawns and some camera locations. Keep in mind the nearest one gets highlighted so you don’t waste time finding survivors or cameras.</p>


    <p>Joseph’s weak areas are two settings such as Big Boat, Hospital or Factory. It’s
        really hard to get a quick down in these areas especially if the Survivor is full health and Joseph
        doesn’t have full presence. If you find yourself in this case, camera ASAP or pressure and change
        targets.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: On Sacred Heart Hospital, the head of the statue turns to the nearest player. If you’re daring
            enough, you can use it to try and figure out if a survivor is nearby in the real world from the
            camera world.</p>

    <h2>Red Church</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063301/Red_Church_Route_ihtyl0.png" alt="Red Church Route">
    </div>

<p>For this example, we see our team comp consisting of  Mercenary, Prisoner, Perfumer and Little Girl.
    There’s a good chance the Decoder will always take a building spawn. In this case, I’d assume Shack since there’s a Mercenary and Perfumer
    who have a chance of taking middle. Perfumer could’ve also chosen a kiting area like Wedding
    or Graveyard but she took middle in this example. Little Girl is probably the random “doesn’t
    make sense” spawn, because she’ll just teleport away. So as Joseph, spawn on the right in the
    middle. Keep in mind that routes are never the same and have to be adapted to your current situation on the fly.</p>

    <p>We see that the top right corner ended up being LG so she’ll probably TP away to Mercenary,
        because of his slow decoding and distance. Use a camera and head over to Shack to
        down the prisoner and carry his clone. From there, go into Church to find the Perfumer’s clone. It
        depends on how confident you are and how smart the Perfumer is. You can either farm
        presence or take the gamble of leaving her at instant knockdown. If the
        Perfumer is smart, she might perfume before the camera ends so that way when the camera
        damage is inflicted, she’ll perfume back to full hp. If you have enough time, definitely try getting
        to Wedding since LG and Mercenary are probably there.</p>

        <p>You might not get the hits in time and
            prioritize Prisoner’s clone. When the camera ends, you can chose to go after the Perfumer (if
            she wasn’t smart), the Prisoner (but he might be hiding and it’ll waste time) or if you got a hit on
            LG and Merc, you can try going after them too.</p>

    <h2>Arms Factory</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083087/arms-route_r43daq.png" alt="Arms Factory Route">
    </div>
<p> This is more or less pick your poison, try and get the
    bigger threats injured or downed.</p>
    <h2>Eversleeping Town</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083081/eversleeping-route_cd6ftg.png" alt="Eversleeping Town Route">
    </div>
<p>Again, more or less pick your poison or whoever is most convient to get clone damage. If there’s
    a doctor or puppeteer, I’d knock the clones fully down that way you get to full presence quicker.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Sacred Heart Hospital</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083080/hospital-route_ch0np4.png" alt="Hospital Route">
    </div>
<p>Go for the biggest threats first. This is just my guessing of a route solely based on spawns
    really.</p>

    <h2>Moonlit River Park</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083080/moonlit-route_f7wpbb.png" alt="Moonlit River Park Route">
    </div>
<p>One of the bigger maps with really spread out spawns so this one is gonna be a rough camera
    honestly. I’d go either direction but target the threats more for the first clone.</p>

    <h2>Leo's Memory</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083082/leos-route_mpzcjn.png" alt="Leos Memory Route">
    </div>
<p>Just follow the arrows. Personally I never take Joseph on Leo’s just because it’s so bad.</p>

<h2>Chinatown</h2>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083087/chinatown-route_gv23ru.png" alt="Chinatown Route">
</div>

<p>Chinatown is also a pretty painful map for Joseph. Pick your poison and just take out threats or
    at that point, whoever is most convenient</p>

<h2>Lakeside Village</h2>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733083079/lakeside-route_w0yzke.png" alt="Lakeside Route">
</div>
<p>I wouldn’t go into boat especially without presence...</p>
    
    <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>For Joseph, you’ll always want to start off with a camera. Most the times, survivors hide upon
    the realization of Photographer being played so it’s good to know common spots they tend to
    hide in such as corners, pallets, tall grass, and behind or right next to objects. Check back on
    replays and look where survivors are hiding. For players under Tier V, it’s heavily advised to
    memorize spawns and plan out routes for him to farm clones. Joseph is heavily dependent on
    his first camera because of his weak chase. If the first camera doesn’t go so well, don’t
    panic.</p>

    <p>Going back to the route, knock down the
        first clone, pick them up and without chairing, continue to find other clones. If it is a small map or
        a crowded area, you can potentially get two clones on chair. If things are spread out or it took a
        while for the first clone, only hit the other clones once. Worst case, immediately chair the only
        clone damaged than risk running out of camera time trying to find other clones. Unless there is a
        doctor or puppeteer, this causes them to be at un-healable states, putting them at an instant
        knockdown. If there is a Doctor or Puppeteer, personally I knock the clones down just for
        Presence.</p>

        <p>If a survivor’s clone is on chair and does not get rescued, the real world Survivor will be downed
            and in most cases, the survivors will rotate heavily and hide in order for Joseph not to chair
            them. If you can’t predict or figure out where the survivor has died off, you might have to start up
            a chase. Hopefully, the survivors have some damage on them after the first camera, that way
            when a chase opens, the Survivor is at an instant knockdown. If the first camera was really bad,
            getting into a chase with a full health survivor will significantly kill
            and waste time, allowing survivors to heal and decode.</p>

        <p>When you unlock Joseph’s second presence, it's a much better advantage for him because he
            can counter looping, pressure even better and if you’re running TP you can technically card trick
            back.</p>

    </video>

    <p>For a majority of the match, always take a picture whenever camera is up and don’t prioritize
        chases in the real world. Try to pressure ciphers on chairs and mind game A LOT with survivors
        because Joseph is pure manipulation and control. Try and always keep survivors damaged to
        prevent rescues and slow decoding. It’s good to lock in on a target towards the end but for the
        beginning, it’s more or less whoever is closest or whoever you won’t have a problem getting
        down. On chair try and force rescues too to not kill time.</p>

        <p>The more you practice Joseph, the more you’ll understand how survivors act when they
            encounter him and you’ll eventually get an intuition just through experience and knowledge.</p>
