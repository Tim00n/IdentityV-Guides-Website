    <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>

    <p>Wu Chang is a map control hunter with a weak chase. His kit is built around teleportation, which is his primary chase ability that also allows him to keep tabs on ciphers at endgame. Like many snowball hunters, Wu Chang struggles to get a first down without Insolence or Blink, but can close distances very easily.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063293/ability_net_zt4lng.jpg" alt="Wu Chang's Strengths and Weaknesses">
    </div>

    <h2 id="external-traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>
    <p>Dual Soul is Wu Chang’s external trait. This hunter consists of two people, White Guard (Xie Bi’an) and Black Guard (Fan Wujiu). He can switch between the guards, each with different abilities, interaction speeds, and attack judgments.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063295/external_trait__dual_soul_x4gfnu.jpg" alt="Wu Chang External Trait: Dual Soul">
    </div>

    <p><strong>White Guard has:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Longer attack speed</li>
      <li>Longer attack hitboxes (5.49m charge hitbox) and “residual” attack </li>
      <li>Faster walking speed</li>
      <li>Slower pallet stun recovery</li>
      <li>Slower pallet breaking and vaulting</li>
      <li>Speed ability
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Black Guard has:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quicker attack speed</li>
      <li>Shorter hitbox</li>
      <li>Slower walking speed</li>
      <li>Faster pallet breaking and vaulting</li>
      <li>Faster pallet stun recovery</li>
      <li>Stun ability 
    </ul>


<p>Every match starts with the White Guard, and every teleport will switch which guard you are using. White Guard is generally better at dealing with transitional kiting, while Black Guard deals with tight kiting. Switch between guards using the ability Summon. Tapping the ability will instantly change your guard’s form, and holding it will display a yellow dot that gradually moves away from you and is not visible to survivors. Releasing the button will let you teleport to the dot, up to 84.4 meters. Wu Chang cannot teleport to the opposite gate on Moonlit or Lakeside. You will know that you have hit this limit because the holding animation will change. The longer you teleport, the longer the Summon animation will take. This ability’s cooldown is 30 seconds, you must be careful when considering when is an appropriate time to use it. 
</p>

    </div>

<p>Right after using Summon, all of your interaction speeds including walking, pallet breaking, vaulting, and attacking will be increased. This small buff can be utilized during chase, and can actually be game-changing considering survivors will underestimate it. Additionally, you cannot teleport to places with significantly higher elevation than where you are standing, so you cannot teleport out of basement, up into a second story, etc. However you can teleport to slightly higher areas including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first few steps on stairs</li>
      <li>The docks on Lakeside</li>
      <li>Up into the Hospital</li>
      <li>First and fourth stops on Moonlit</li>
      <li>Up onto the stage of Moonlit’s one-story building</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lastly, the animation can actually cancel some stuns.</p>

<p>Used alongside Summon, the ability Infinite Nirvana lets you throw out the umbrella onto the map without you automatically teleporting to it. Once thrown out, the umbrella will create a radius in which survivors will be highlighted through walls, and all of their interactions like decoding, vaulting, and movement will be decreased. If survivors move out of this radius, their outline will be shown for an additional 5 seconds. You will not be able to break pallets, but you can vault windows, which can prove useful in certain situations. Your vaulting and walking speed will also be increased. You can choose to either commit and teleport to the umbrella, or pull it back. This pull back animation can be cancelled with peeper, or more realistically, bell.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Wu Chang’s first presence ability changes depending on which guard is on the field.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063293/ability__siphon_bell_s4h2od.jpg" alt="Ability: Siphon/Bell">
    </div>

<p>The White Guard can Soul Siphon, an ability that greatly improves movement speed to 7.7 m/s, and is great for closing in distances, however Wu Chang cannot interact with anything while using the ability.

    If you are on top of a survivor while using this ability, you will see a small white bar on top of their head. After 3 seconds, a high ringing sound effect will indicate they are fully siphoned. They will hallucinate that their teammates are dead and have trouble figuring out where you are coming from, and most importantly, they will not be able to vault, rescue, or decode. Keep in mind that survivors can still use abilities during this time. 
    </p>    

    <p>You can cancel Soul Siphon when the ability bar reaches 70%. Excitement and blink are the only traits that may be used during Soul Siphon. Lastly, survivors can flywheel Soul Siphon, so a common tactic Wu Chang may use is to turn away right before reaching 100% siphon to bait out flywheel, then face the survivor again to finish them off. 

        Wavering Soul, more commonly known as bell, is the ability available to Black Guard. This ability can stun survivors for about 1.5 seconds, during which they cannot use any items and are forced to do a calibration. If the survivor fails a calibration within 60 seconds of each other, their controls will be reversed for 10 seconds. 
    
        An important thing to note is that vaulting and pallet drop animations will cancel bell, but bell can cancel a rescue. When the survivor isn’t about to vault, aim the bell with your body, not your camera. This aiming can be nuanced to master, but can be especially strong in tight kiting situations. If you are able to stun a survivor from behind a pallet, be aware they might intentionally fail the calibration and surprise you with a pallet stun. 
    
        The bell works on small elevations like stairs, as well as canceling Patient and Toy Merchant’s ability animations.

<p>Lost Wavering Soul is an extremely rare combination of Siphon and Bell. It’s so rare that most people don’t even recognize its name, not even its callout “tags”.  Its rarity is partially due to the fact that it is fully dependent on survivor error. It only happens when a survivor manages to get soul siphoned while having reversed controls, a situation only feasible with full presence. It makes the survivor ridiculously slow. I mean, ridiculously slow. </p>

    <p>As siphon and bell are the same ability, they have the same cooldown of 12 seconds. However, a teleport will reset this cooldown. So if you somehow overshoot the teleport and have trouble getting a survivor down, you can immediately use this secondary ability to patch up this mistake. Without this ability, however, you are completely dependent on your proficiency with your umbrella. 

        Wu Chang’s full presence finally allows him to get some endgame momentum. 
    </p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733063291/ability__full_presence_bli5wu.jpg" alt="Ability: Infinite Nirvana">
    </div>

    <p>The Summon animation will be faster, and upon teleportation, Wu Chang will immediately apply a Soul Siphon or Bell effect in a large radius, depending on the form you are turning into. The timing for this application is different for each, so it’s difficult for survivors to flywheel it. 
        Additionally, the auto-siphon/bell will cancel stuns. 
    </p>

    <p>	Coupled with accurate teleports, full presence should be able to guarantee a hit.
    </p>

    <h2 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h2>
    <p>This section will touch upon different playstyles and what builds will compliment them. Wu Chang must always carry detention because their endgame teleportation could possibly turn a game around. Of course, Mock (buffs movement speed when there is a survivor on chair) and Inertia (increases your attack recovery throughout the entire game) come with Detention.</p>

    <p>Do not bother with Trump Card on Wu Chang. As their early game is so weak, they need a build that will enhance chase. Blink alone may not be strong enough to get a down with Wu Chang. Just let Summon act as your Teleport.</p>

    <p>Insolence is the recommended build for Wu Chang. It is the “safer” option because at the beginning of the game, Wu Chang only has a teleport, and if you make a mistake on that, you’re stuck chasing on foot for the next 30 seconds. Having insolence lets you unlock abilities faster, and thus provides a backup.</p>

    <p>Insolence also has built-in stun resistance with Tolerance, which is useful as Wu Chang is very weak to stun harassment. This path also makes slugging easier with After Effects and Deer Hunt, something that Wu Chang mains infamously love to do. After Effects decreases the self-heal limit after a survivor is picked up without using exit path, and Deer hunt allows you to see downed survivors within an 18 meter radius. More practically speaking, it is often necessary to keep survivors on the ground and force them to use a self-heal to help control the endgame. This build is easier to use and thus better fit for beginners.</p>

    <p>I also include Impulsive in this build, which will increase your movement speed by 8% when charge attacking. This is incredibly useful when cutting corners and landing long-range hits in tight kiting. You can easily start your attack at around 8 meters away from the survivor. It is also surprisingly useful on Black Guard, even if he doesn’t have the hitbox of a continent, it lets him just barely catch up to survivors before they can get behind pallets. With Impulsive comes No Survivors, which will increase your attack recovery by 8% when in a 25 meter radius of a downed survivor, useful against harrassers.</p>

    <p>This build also carries Destructiveness, also known as fast pallet breaking, which Wu Chang can really benefit from in early game. Deterioration makes survivor’s decoding and healing speeds slower when they are injured, and Wither will decrease the movement speed granted to a survivor upon getting injured if somebody is on chair. Constrain is carried on virtually every hunter build, which locks the furthest survivor from where you spawn, giving you an advantage on early game rotation.</p>

    <p>An older playstyle for Wu Chang is a confined space build. You need to be really good at using umbrella efficiently, like knowing when to use it and sacrifice it for the long cooldown, knowing when to hold it and only use it for mindgames, etc.</p>

    <p>This build makes tight kiting difficult as it can stop window looping and force survivors to transition early. Pallet spam is a cheap counter to a low presence Wu Chang, so carrying Confined and its built in Destructiveness can mitigate this counterplay.</p>

    <p>Carrying Confined is “cheaper” than carrying Insolence as it has more stacks of things built into the path, allowing you to allocate points to other buffs while still having a final talent. This lets you put more points into things like Beserker, which can be important considering how dependent Wu Chang is on spreading damage, especially on rescuers.</p>

    <p>Beserker can be swapped out for Rage or Desperate Fight to counter stunners. Announcement will highlight where survivors are for 5 seconds after the final cipher pops, again very useful for an endgame turnaround. Nostalgic highlights the survivor that just got off of chair after a rescue, making double downs much easier (e.g. getting an extra hit on the rescuer, then quickly catching up to the survivor with Summon, knowing exactly where they are thanks to the highlight).</p>

    <p>There is also Impulsive, Constrain, Wither, and Deer Hunt, but it is customizable depending on your preferred playstyle.</p>

    <p>As for traits, Blink is the best option. It will guarantee a hit, which is often necessary to unlock insolence. Without Trump Card, you’ll have Blink the entire game, letting you get downs easily throughout the course of the match.</p>

    <p>Peeper Wu Chang may sound ridiculous at first, but it’s actually rank viable, albeit risky. It allows you to control ciphers as peepers will slow down decoding, a good buff on top of Infinite Nirvana’s. Of course, it can also be chase oriented, assisting you in tight kiting situations. The most notable usage of Peepers on Wu Chang is that it will let you know where survivors are, making it easier to jumpscare them without fear that you’ll teleport to the middle of nowhere.</p>

    <p>Don’t bother with bringing something that isn’t chase oriented. Bring teleport and you’ll never get a down (as long as the survivor doesn’t run around nilly-willy), bring patroller or abnormal and you’re asking for a death sentence. Besides, you already have a warp or teleport built in with your umbrella. If you’re that adamant on getting your Wu Chang points, bringing Excitement to counter a stun-heavy comp will only get you a tie at most. Personally, I prefer to bring a build with Rage and Desperate Fight and use the umbrella to close distance after getting stunned.</p>



    <h2 id="map-viability">Map Viability</h2>

<h3>Moonlit River Park</h3>
<p>Starting with the best map for Wu Chang, Moonlit River Park is very open as well as large, which is good for teleport hunters. There are less windows on this map, and the coaster is easily dealt with. You can teleport up onto the first and fourth platforms and go from station to station. Just remember, you need to predict the survivor’s routing if they get on coaster. If they do use coaster and you’re on cooldown for Summon, then you’re in a lot of trouble, so you have to save the ability until after they commit to it.</p>

<p>The window on two-story is a guaranteed hit for Wu Chang as long as you have Summon. This goes for any one-way window (e.g. Hospital windows, Lakeside’s little and big boat windows, Eversleeping’s two-story windows). Put the umbrella under the window, and be careful that you hold the ability long enough so the umbrella isn’t mistakenly placed inside of Funhouse. If the survivor vaults, teleport to the umbrella. If the survivor waits at the window, knowing that there is an umbrella underneath, then use this opportunity to close distance. The survivor will most likely wait for Infinite Nirvana’s pull back animation to vault, but this animation can be cancelled with bell or peeper, hence why I say this is a guaranteed hit.</p>

<p>Around tall walls, you can redlight trick with umbrella or siphon, and you can utilize White Guard’s long hitbox around the smaller tight kiting areas. Additionally, traversing across the river is a piece of cake; just take into account the umbrella’s teleportation judgment, or else you’ll just end up on the same side you were already on. Essentially, the yellow dot will not budge until you hold it long enough.</p>

<p>And generally, around big loops across all maps when the survivor can’t really see you all too well, use Infinite Nirvana to put the umbrella on the other side of the loop behind the wall that is breaking your line of sight. Aim it so it will highlight the survivor, giving you an advantage with visibility. As the survivor will stay highlighted for 5 seconds after leaving Infinite Nirvana’s radius, you can mindgame them by doubling back, tricking them into running into you. You can then choose to either manually walk over to the survivor or teleport to the umbrella, depending on where they are.</p>

<h3>Eversleeping Town and Chinatown</h3>
<p>These two maps are both about equally good for Wu Chang. Starting with Eversleeping, he can counter the tram and once again use Infinite Nirvana to counter windows.</p>

</video>

<p>One of the most powerful loops on Eversleeping is the shack loop, followed by corner house’s loop. These can both be dealt with by a Wu Chang by putting the umbrella on the other side of the building, letting you see where the survivor is, and then mindgaming until they run into you or the umbrella, like mentioned before. Just like Chinatown, the reason that these two maps are good for Wu Chang is the alleyways, limited visibility of survivors (thus they cannot see when you are holding Summon), and size of the maps.</p>

<h3>Leos Memory and Lakeside Village</h3>
<p>These maps are a bit more difficult for Wu Chang to deal with, but the job is made easier with confined space. Without it, you’re just going to get looped endlessly around places like logs, small boat, Godkites, etc.</p>

<p>Wu Chang struggles in Leos Memory due to the amount of pallets and general difficulty of traversal of kiting areas and factory. However he can use Soul Siphon’s speed boost in large areas, and cut off stairs from inside the building using umbrella.</p>

<p>He may struggle in Lakeside for the same reasons, with the only upsides being better visibility for teleports in big boat, and a large map. The worst thing about Lakeside is the distance of the gates. Holding the umbrella from front gate and waiting until it is charged to its maximum distance, you will only make it to the start of cornfield. However with confined, you can manage chase, utilizing long hitboxes in places like shore or front gate. Of course you can also use umbrella to close distances or threaten windows on the two boats, as demonstrated above.</p>

<h3>Red Church, Arms Factory, and Hospital</h3>
<p>Bringing Wu Chang on these three maps takes a lot of skill. Red Church can at least somewhat be dealt with using red light tricks, but Arms and Hospital are like the survivor’s playground. Godkite on Hospital can be troubling, but using umbrella to threaten the survivor on the other side of walls or windows may mitigate its usefulness. The worst part of Hospital for Wu Chang is actually how easy it is to transition on it, as well as the main building for Hospital. There aren’t any specific tricks for these three maps, all you can do is mindgame with the umbrella to hopefully close distance, as well as improving your aim with bell to quickly cut off a kite.</p>


<h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>

<p>There are two main strategies that Wu Chang uses in the early game. I’ll provide a rundown of both of them.

    Wu Chang may try to jumpscare a survivor on a cipher within the first 5-10 seconds o f the game. You have to have full confirmation that a survivor is there, or else you’ll go nowhere. The umbrella is too valuable to waste.
    
     The cons of this strategy are that you might end up somebody like a Wilding (more counters will be listed down below). You need to have perfect aim in order to get a free hit, or else the survivor will have enough reaction time to rotate away or use their ability. I recommend going into custom mode and practicing blind teleports (basically, teleports where you cannot see your yellow dot). Accuracy will help you throughout your entire match, and will give the survivors a good scare. If you are having trouble with Wu Chang’s teleports, set your custom map to Hospital or Lakeside where you can see how fast the dot travels and how it interacts with certain walls. 
    
    After getting your free first hit, you can either blink down the survivor or, if carrying insolence, use your abilities to down the survivor. If you are lucky enough and know how to chase on foot well with your confined space, you can get a down even faster. It all really depends on how and when you play your cards, like a turn-based game. 
    </p>


<p>The second strategy uses the umbrella as a complimentary chase item, as opposed to an immediate hit. This version requires you to find a survivor on foot, allowing you to pick your chase so you don’t end up going for somebody who hard counters you. With this method you won’t have to wait around until you have confirmation that somebody is on a cipher. Once you lock in onto a survivor, use umbrella to cut off kiting areas and keep them in places where it is easier to chase. 

    When cutting off the survivor, always use Infinite Nirvana first as opposed to Summon. The reason being the survivor may try to double back and trick you when they see the beginning of the Summon animation, gaining a lot of distance on you and nullifying the distance you are trying to close. Make sure to only commit to a teleport when you know that you’ll get a hit. In a lot of instances, you’ll only use Infinite Nirvana to know where the survivor is and stop them in their tracks while giving yourself the small speed buff. 
    
    Endgame is where Wu Chang thrives, go absolutely beserk with cipher control. Keep tabs on what items survivors have, whether they have Exit Path or not, even predicting their exact rotation. It’s okay if you need to switch targets, just down anybody when you have the easiest opportunity and don’t tilt onto one survivor too much, as long as you can kill two survivors before the cipher pop.
    
        While camping, use umbrella as a sort of built-in Wanted Order to decrease the decoding speed and scare survivors off of ciphers while you’re at chair. 
    </p>

    </video>

    <p>You can also proxy camp, straying away from the chair in hopes of cutting off a rescuer and teleporting back only when necessary. Remember, spreading damage is extremely important for map control hunters, and camping is the best time to capitalize on that. Generally, there shouldn’t be a time where you’re not using your umbrella unless you’re waiting for the perfect opening to Summon/Infinite Nirvana. Whether it be for mindgames, finding survivors, threatening ciphers.

        As your items are so limited you have to anticipate counterplay ex. bell dodges or siphoning flywheels. 
        
        Don’t abuse White Guard’s hitbox, remember he still has a short miss attack recovery that will allow the survivor to rotate to a pallet, and you’ll end up getting looped even longer. Familiarize yourself with the length of the hitbox. When blinking as White Guard, the basic attack has a longer residual hit window, so if you initially miss you can quickly rotate your camera and connect the hit with the survivor then. This isn’t the case with the charged hitbox, once the animation is over, the hit judgment is over as well. 
        
        You don’t have the hitbox advantage with Black Guard, so if the survivor is gaining too much distance, you can first try to use the bell to get them through the pallet or window, then blink to catch up.

        <ul>
            <li>It’s Round 3, so the meta hunters are all banned, making it a free-for-all.</li>
            <li>None of the survivors necessarily hard counter Wu Chang. Acrobat, however, may be some trouble.</li>
            <li>The map is Lakeside Village, which is viable for Wu Chang.</li>
            <li>DongXuan is a known Wu Chang main.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>DX chooses blink, insolence, and detention. He immediately heads towards logs on foot, throwing out Infinite Nirvana to find Entomologist, the easiest chase in the comp (Novelist was considered meta during this COA). As he rotates, he continues to use Infinite Nirvana to seek out where survivors may hide, hoping to disturb some ciphers. He ultimately locks in on the Acrobat at shore.</p>
        
        <p>He tries to use umbrella to threaten the Acrobat to transition and would have landed a hit if not for the mud ball. Immediately after, he uses Infinite Nirvana to do the same trick again, this time getting a hit after Summoning. Now on cooldown, he chases Acrobat into big boat, using blink to get a dropdown hit at the window, resulting in a relatively early down and massive advantage for Wu Chang. DX gets extremely lucky with basement spawning in big boat as well.</p>
      
        <p>While he camps above the entrance, he continually throws out umbrella right under the hole in case a survivor drops down to rescue. The main reason for this is to know where the rescue is coming from, not necessarily to commit to a teleportation. DX keeps charge attacking because he has Impulsive, but gets countered by AK’s (Novelist’s) flywheel. He fails an attempt to bell through the wall, but if it weren’t for the survivors’ speed boost after a rescue, that bell would have landed due to the elevation being low enough.</p>
      
        <p>Once again, when going up and down the stairs of big boat to proxy camp, he puts umbrella at the dropdown hole, always using his ability to keep tabs on survivors’ movements as he has tinnitus. This is what you should be doing at all times as a Wu Chang, maximizing the usage of your strongest ability. He finds AK, but AK takes the window vault, canceling the bell animation. At this point, he knows it is safe to switch targets because he has found the person feeding tinnitus. Thanks to insolence he is already at full presence and easily downs AK thanks to the speed and attack boosts granted after a teleport.</p>
      
        <p>Right before the rescue, DX switches from White to Black Guard to gain a faster attack recovery alongside buffs after a Summon. His main goal is to cut off any potential rebound kite using full presence auto-bell, prioritizing securing the Novelist before the last cipher pops. Novelist would have had incredible rebound potential with Wu Chang because he had a book and full kite build (both flywheel and windows).</p>
      
        <p>DX tries to go for a double hit on the Gravekeeper to maximize damage spread, unafraid of a pallet stun and walking right through it without being punished, thanks to Impulsive. As soon as Gravekeeper goes into shovel, he deems the chase too difficult as it would waste too much time and he needs to find his original target, being a single-hit hunter. Novelist ends up using self-heal, which may initially seem bad for DX, but considering he banned a healer earlier, the survivors must waste extra time to heal the Novelist. Plus, he doesn’t have Exit Path anymore, which may help in endgame.</p>
      
        <p>Note how DX pretends to aim umbrella and change target frequently, especially when Gravekeeper returns to shovel. In tournaments, the survivors are in a VC, allowing them to call out a Wu Chang holding umbrella. This forces quick action, which isn’t always beneficial, as it pulls survivors off ciphers while making Gravekeeper cancel his ability. DX misses the Infinite Nirvana but makes up for it by using blink and downing the Gravekeeper. Now that the Novelist is healed, his main priority isn’t to tunnel but to control ciphers, hence his confidence about leaving the Gravekeeper’s chair.</p>
      
        <p>DX gets lucky again, landing a terrorshock on the Novelist after teleporting to his cipher. The passive buff after teleporting proves game-changing, as AK believed he was safe vaulting the pallet due to White Guard’s slower attack speed. One of my favorite competitive Wu Chang moments.</p>
      
        <p>He finds and cuts off Entomologist, who is coming in for the rescue, and decides to siphon her. DX’s camera movement is unusual here as he anticipates a flywheel. Though she doesn’t have it, had she used it, DX’s continuous turning would likely have caused her to flywheel too early, still getting siphoned. He completely stuffs the rescue, even teleporting to the chair to gain faster attack recovery, and thus begins the slow process of slugging. He eventually secures a 4k.</p>

<p>When playing White Guard, you’ll use your charge attack to stop tight kiting and hit the survivor right before they get to the pallet. This is countered by tank/bodyblock survivors.
    Healers and stunners are also difficult for Wu Chang to deal with because they can help alleviate endgame pressure.
