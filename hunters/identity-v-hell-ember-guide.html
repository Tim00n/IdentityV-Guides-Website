        <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>
        <p>Hell Ember is a camp / control single hit Hunter. He's often rightfully considered one of the weakest hunters in IdentityV, because of his terrible early game and below-average chase outweighing his good camp and above-average late game.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733615238/hell-ember-strengths-and-weaknesses_edo5ea.webp" alt="Hell Ember Strengths and Weaknesses">
        </div>
<p> However, a good Hell Ember can utterly crush teams if his good camp and late game are underestimated.</p>


        <h2 id="traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>
        <p>Hell Ember only has one external trait: Infernal Soul. When he's chasing a Survivor, stunned, or when a cipher is popped, he gains Fury that he can use for his abilities. Keep in mind that once all ciphers have been popped, you'll only gain Fury very slowly.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/infernal-soul_e6z75n.png" alt="Infernal Soul">
        </div>

        <p>Hell Ember only starts the match with his ability Awaken charged at 80%. 
            He accumulates rage at a rate of 0,2%/s, which is why his early game is so slow. 
            He can use it to spawn a Phantom for 25 seconds. 
            It breaks pallets for him and targets nearby survivors or the one you selected.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/awaken_m87k0q.png" alt="Awaken Ability">
        </div>
        <p>As you can see while a Phantom is breaking a pallet you can already walk through it during animation.</p>

        <p>Awaken can also be used on the Yellow Puppet and Red Puppet, creating the same effect as for Phantoms. Keep in mind that Phantoms count as solid objects and Puppets don't.</p>

<p>Hell Ember's main ability is his Puppets. They're inherently unique but also share some commonalities that you should know of: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Puppets detect nearby survivors letting Hell Ember proxy camp easily. They also have their own fear radius that alerts survivors.</li>
            <li>You can swap places with Puppets (Cooldown: 20 seconds). This stops them from moving and gives you a 50% movement speed boost for 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>Puppets can be dismantled, which stops you from changing places with them. They can also be destroyed (Cooldown: 45 seconds).</li>
            <li>Puppets can't be recalled remotely but only by manually picking them up.</li>
            <li>When Puppets hit a Survivor, they enter attack recovery and become stationary. </li>
            <li>Fury from Puppets can't be recalled.</li>
            <li>Puppets can't vault windows (with the exception of Chinatown) or fall from two story buildings.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <p>When swapping places with a Puppet your camera is snapped to the nearest Survivor.</p>

        <p>The Yellow Puppet unlocks after achieving first presence. It can be used for proxy camping and closing distance or drop-down hits, but not puppet tricks.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/puppet-control_kjinqv.png" alt="Yellow Puppet">
        </div>

        <p>The Red Puppet unlocks at full presence and can be used for all kinds of puppet tricks.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/multiple-puppet-control_shdn4r.png" alt="Red Puppet">
        </div>

        <p>Puppets throwing animation can be canceled. Can Emma vault chinatown? Harassing Ember.</p>

        <p>An important realization that you should have is that Hell Ember can be in three places at once:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current position</li>
            <li>Yellow Puppet</li>
            <li>Red Puppet</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733616050/hell-ember-everywhere_runpe6.png" alt="Red Puppet">
        </div>


        <p>With Teleport, this could add up to a total of four different places at once. Use Puppets for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gates</li>
            <li>Ciphers</li>
            <li>Camp</li>
            <li>Chase</li>
        </ul>

<p>Make sure to take the time and manually recall Puppets that aren't being used anymore. If you're far away from a Puppet and don't want to swap just use Fury on it once to get it to patroll ciphers for you if you can afford it. Puppets always try to locate survivors near ciphers and will proceed to chase them if they find them there. Otherwise they'll go to the next cipher.</p>
<p>During late game when the gates have been activated Puppets and Phantoms will continiously walk from gate to gate patrolling it for you.</p>

        <h1 id="persona-web">Persona Webs and Traits</h1>
        <p>In this section different Persona Webs and Traits are discussed, which represent different strategies and playstyles. There are two main builds for Hell Ember, but the most popular one is the Insolence-Detention build.

<p>Hunt also counters Journalist, allowing you to chase her first. Control Freak stacks with dolls dropdown. Hunt doesnt cancel fury.</p>
        <h2 id="camping">Camping</h2>

        <p>A Phantom only becomes active after 4.5 seconds. Keep in mind Flywheel exists and the Phantom can hit the chair. You can precharge Puppets with Fury. Put down a Yellow Puppet with 1 almost 2 Fury stacks. Don't activate it. Swap to it and recall it. Use 1 Fury on the Yellow Doll letting your last rage stack charge so you have another.</p>

<p>Now wait for the rescuer and stall time. Deploy the Yellow Puppet near the chair. It'll start moving instantly. Deploy a Phantom as soon as possible. The rescuer should panic and one tap the Yellow Puppet (3 seconds) giving you enough time to hit them before they rescue. After the rescue the Phantom will immediately down the rescuer and if it's primed they would usually pop. This is where the Yellow Doll activates and immediately downs the rescuer again after the pop. </p>

        <p> Your only real ways of winning or tying with Hell Ember come down to these three options: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ending your first chase quickly enough for them to sell. This is highly unlikely. </li>
                <li>Completely denying the first rescue and the follow up. This is possible, but difficult. </li>
                <li>Late game</li>
            </ul>

<p>For your convenience we'll go through replays that demonstrate all three of these possibilities and talk through them.</p>
