        <h2 id="classification">Classification and Type</h2>
        <p>Hell Ember is a Camp / Control single hit Hunter. He's often rightfully considered one of the weakest hunters in IdentityV, because of his terrible early game and below-average Chase outweighing his good Camp and above-average late game.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733615238/hell-ember-strengths-and-weaknesses_edo5ea.webp" alt="Hell Ember Strengths and Weaknesses">
        </div>
<p> However, a good Hell Ember can utterly crush teams with his Camp and late game if he's understimated. Nonetheless, he still remains one of the bottom three worst hunters to date.</p>


        <h2 id="traits">External Traits and Abilities</h2>
        <p>Hell Ember only has one external trait: Infernal Soul. When he's chasing a Survivor, stunned or when a cipher is popped, he gains Rage that he can use for his abilities. Keep in mind that during late game you'll only gain Rage slowly.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/infernal-soul_e6z75n.png" alt="Infernal Soul">
        </div>

        <p>Hell Ember only starts the match with his ability Awaken charged at 80%, which makes his early game slow. 
            He accumulates Rage at a rate of 0,2%/s, which he can use to spawn a Phantom for 25 seconds or awaken a Puppet. 
          
        
                <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/awaken_m87k0q.png" alt="Awaken Ability">
        </div>

        There are some things that you should know about Phantoms to be able to use them to their full potential.
        <ul>
            <li> Phantoms have their own fear radius that alerts survivors of their presence.  </li>
            <li> Phantoms break pallets and Chase the selected Survivor for Hell Ember or patrol from cipher to cipher if nobody is selected. </li>
            <li> During late game they'll patrol the gates automatically.</li>
            <li> They can be recalled, recovering a percentage of Rage according to the remaining time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When a Phantom or Puppet is breaking a pallet you can already walk through it during the animation. This can be helpful for instantly getting a hit or quickly catching up.</p>

          <p>When choosing your spawn or chasing you should rememeber that Phantoms and Puppets can't vault windows or fall from two story buildings. However, Phantoms are able to vault the small windows on Chinatown.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that Phantoms count as solid objects and Puppets don't. This means you can block stuns like Coordinator's Flare Gun or Forwards Rugby Ball with Phantoms but not Puppets.</p>

<p>Hell Ember's main abilities are his two Puppets: The Yellow Puppet and Red Puppet. They're inherently unique, but both Puppets share some traits you should know of. </p>
<ul>
        <li>Puppets detect nearby survivors letting Hell Ember proxy Camp easily. 
        They also have their own fear radius that alerts survivors of their presence.  </li>
        <li>Puppets always try to locate survivors near ciphers and will proceed to Chase them if they find them. Otherwise they'll go to the next cipher.</li>
        <li>During late game they'll patrol the gates automatically if awakend.</li>
        <li>Puppets aren't on a timer, but can be dismantled, which stops you from changing places with them. They can also be destroyed (Cooldown: 45 seconds).</li>
        <li>Puppets can't be recalled remotely but only by manually picking them up. Rage also can't be recalled once used.</li>
        <li>When Puppets hit a Survivor, they enter attack recovery and become stationary. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can switch positions with Puppets (Cooldown: 20 seconds). This stops them from moving and gives you a 50% movement speed boost for 3 seconds. It also snaps your camera to the nearest Survivor.</p>

        <p> Im summary, Phantoms should be primarily used for Chase or Camp depending on how much Rage you've got. They are subpar at Control.
            Puppets are much better at Control, because they're not on a timer, they alert you of survivors locations and allow you to switch positions. 
           
            <p>Try to use Puppets strategically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure you prepare for late game by positioning your Puppets in key positions like Gates ahead of time or having both of them on hand before late game starts.</li>
                <li>Using Puppets to lock ciphers for a while, can buy you time. Just be mindful of the 45 second cooldown.</li>
                <li>Manually recall Puppets that aren't being used anymore. Use Rage wisely to get them to patroll ciphers for you if they're far away and if you can afford it.
                </li>
                <li>If the circumstances allow Puppets can be used to quickly close large distance or for Camp if you don't have Rage.</li>
              
            </ul> 

<p>The Yellow Puppet unlocks after achieving first presence. It can be used for everything previously discussed, excluding Puppet Tricks.</p>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsim8rimy/image/upload/v1733610768/puppet-control_kjinqv.png" alt="Yellow Puppet">
</div>
<p>The only two tricks that are possible with the Yellow Puppet are the dropdown hit and dropdown blink hit.</p>

  </video>
  <p>It should be noted that this trick is situational at best and not nearly consistent enough. To ensure maximum consitency you should try to primarily use the Yellow Puppet for proxy Camping, controlling or to close distance.</p>

<p>The Red Puppet unlocks at full presence. It can also be used for everything we've talked about including Puppet Tricks. These are unique to the Red Puppet and not replicable otherwise.</p>
<div class="image-container">

</div>

<p>To start learning Puppet Tricks you must first learn how to cancel the throwing animation of Puppets. Start by throwing the Puppet and then simply pressing the key again once more. The animation will be stopped abruptly and you can press the button again to switch positions.</p>
   <p>It should look like this if you manage to do it succesfuly.</p>

  <h2 id="Camping">Camping</h2>
  <p>The classic way of camping with Hell Ember consists of simply deploying a Phantom at the chair and either double hitting the Rescuer or building up enough time pressure for a terror shock.</p>
  <video width="600" controls>

      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>       
  <p> You can awaken Puppets before throwing them so that they insta-hit or at least start walking immediately. For this trick you need at least one almost two stacks of Rage. 
              Awaken your Puppet, but don't throw it: Let your Rage charge so you can get another. </p>
  
  <p>Now wait for the Rescuer and stall time. Deploy the Puppet near the chair. 
      It'll start moving towards the Rescuer instantly. Deploy a Phantom as soon as possible, since it takes 4,5 seconds to become active. The disappearing glowing ring around the Phantom gives you an indication of the remaining time.
  </p><p>The Rescuer should panic and one tap the Puppet (3 seconds) giving your Phantom enough time to cooldown. Make sure to hit the Rescuer before they rescue. 
      After they rescue the Phantom will immediately down the Rescuer and if it's primed they usually pop. The Puppet will activate in time and immediately down the Rescuer again after the pop. This puts you into an instant Tie game scenario. </p>
  
  <p>If they don't one tap the Puppet they'll most likely take a hit in which case you should also hit them so the Phantom can down them again after the pop. Either way they'll be trapped.</p>

    <p>Another trick you can use is deploying a Puppet as close to the chair as possible then hitting the Rescuer and activating the Puppet immediately.</p>

<p>The Red Puppet can be used for camping exceptionally well even in combination with Blink. </p>

  <p>Keep in mind that the A.I is far from perfect and Phantoms will hit the chair. Also remember that Flywheel exists. Never panic while camping with Hell Ember, try to stay calm and collected as well as patient.</p>


    <p>If survivors are far away you can use the camera snap trick in combination with the Yellow Puppet to proxy camp and cut off the Rescuer. This has to be done if they sell early game.</p>

        <p>In this section different Persona Webs and Traits are discussed, which represent different strategies and playstyles. There are two main builds for Hell Ember, but the most popular one is the Insolence-Detention build.

        <p> Hell Ember only really has three opportunities to win: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ending your first Chase quickly enough for them to sell. This is highly unlikely. </li>
                <li>Completely denying the first rescue and the follow up. This is possible, but difficult. </li>
                <li>Late game</li>
            </ul>

<p>For your convenience we'll go through replays that demonstrate all three of these possibilities and talk through them.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to realize for a succesful late game is that Hell Ember can be at three places at the same time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current position</li>
    <li>Yellow Puppet</li>
    <li>Red Puppet</li>
</ul>

</div>


<p>With Teleport, this could add up to a total of four different places at once.         </p>
